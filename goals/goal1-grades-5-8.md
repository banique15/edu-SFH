## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of a world where everyone has their basic needs met. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 1 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Write a Challenge and Hope Letter:** Select one challenge and a corresponding solution from one of the lessons. Write a short, persuasive letter to a local city council member, community board leader, etc. using the vivid language from the writing exercises to describe the problem and advocate for the solution.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research contact information and mail/email a letter advocating for a pro-poor policy or community initiative to one local leader.
- **Organize a Basic Needs Swap:** Organize a gently used clothing/book swap in the classroom or neighborhood. This helps provide essential items without cost, ensuring access for the poor and vulnerable.
  - **Concrete Action:** Plan and execute a single-day swap event to redistribute usable clothing and/or books within the community.
- **Become a Voice for Basic Needs:** Choose a powerful piece created in the lessons. Share it with family, friends, or on social media to highlight a basic need (like food, shelter, or safety) and why everyone deserves it. This allows a powerful story to be told with art about the dignity of having enough.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share your creative work and a fact about a basic human need (Target 1.4) with at least three people outside of school.
- **Design a Resilience Resource Map:** Create a map (physical or digital) of all the organizations in your community that offer social protection or help build resilience (Target 1.3 & 1.5). This could include food banks, shelters, community health clinics, or after-school programs. This helps identify local safety nets.
  - **Concrete Action:** Create a clear map of local resources and share it with your school counselor or display it in a community space to help direct people to support.
- **Launch a Micro-Kindness Initiative:** Organize a short-term, high-impact drive for a local agency (e.g., a "Warm Sock Drive" for a local shelter or a "Canned Food Donation Day" for a food bank). Focus on the dignity and immediate comfort these small items provide.
  - **Concrete Action:** Organize a week-long donation drive for one specific item (e.g., new toothpaste, warm socks) to benefit a local organization focused on poverty reduction.

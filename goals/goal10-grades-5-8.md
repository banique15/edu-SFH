Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of reducing inequalities and promoting fairness for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 10 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Fairness Ambassadors: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a school event, digital portfolio, or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why fairness and equality matter for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 10 with at least three people outside of school.
Fair Play Audit: Observe how fairness works daily, during recess, in group projects, or even at home with chores. Write a short journal entry or create a simple visual showing one instance of fairness or unfairness observed, and how it connects to Global Goal 10.
Concrete Action: Students create a short Fair Play observation reflecting on fairness in their own lives.
Kindness Campaign: Collaboratively create simple posters, skits, or songs to promote kindness and inclusion at school. These can feature messages like “Everyone Belongs” or “Fairness for All.”
Concrete Action: Small groups create and perform a Kindness Campaign skit or song, or design posters to be displayed in the school hallways.
Diverse Voices Story Circle: Sit with family, friends, and community members from diverse generations and backgrounds and share stories about times they felt included, or times they saw someone stand up for what was fair.
Concrete Action: Students initiative a Diverse Voices story circle with family, friends, or community members, sharing a story about fairness and listening to others’ perspectives.
Research a Champion of Equity: Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to reduce inequalities and promote fairness, either locally or globally. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Champion of Equity, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 10. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Research and present one Champion of Equality to share with family or the class.

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of making cities and human setlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainble. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 11 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Community Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about what makes a community great for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 11 with at least three people outside of school.
Community Walk and Share: Go on a Community Walk in your neighborhood, and look for examples of a safe place, a green space, or something that might need improvement (like a broken bench, trash, etc.). Create a quick sketch or write a short descriptive paragraph about one example found and its connection to Global Goal 11.
Concrete Action: Students explore their local community and identify one example of a safe, inclusive, or sustainable place (or an example of something that could use help to get there), documenting it with a sketch or short writing piece.
Design a Better Community Idea: Choose one small idea for improving the community (e.g., a new bike rack for your school, a mini-garden for a public space, a recycling initiative, etc.). Create a simple drawing or persuasive paragraph explaining the problem and proposed solution(s).
Concrete Action: Students create a Better Community idea and present it to family, friends, or a local community group.
Community Voices Story Circle: Sit with family, friends, and community members from diverse generations and backgrounds and share stories about moments they felt a sense of community, a time their neighborhood came together to overcome a challenge, or a place that makes them feel safe and included in their city or community.
Concrete Action: Students initiative a Community Voices story circle with family, friends, or community members, sharing a personal story about their neighborhood and listening to others’ perspectives.
Research a Community Champion: Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on their city or community. This could be a local architect, a community organizer, a civil rights activist, or someone who started a program to help others. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Community Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 11. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Community Champion to share with family or the class.

## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 9 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become Innovation Communicators:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a school event, digital portfolio, or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why strong infrastructure, smart industries, and new ideas matter for everyone.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 9 with at least three people outside of school.
- **Community Innovation Walk:** Inspired by exploration of infrastructure and industry, go on a Community Innovation Walk in the neighborhood with a friend or trusted adult/family member. Look for examples of infrastructure (roads, bridges, schools, local businesses, etc.) and signs of innovation (solar panels, new buildings, public Wi-Fi, etc.). Create a quick sketch or write a short piece about an example that was found and its connection to Global Goal 9.
  - **Concrete Action:** Students explore their local community and identify one example of infrastructure, industry, or innovation, documenting it with writing or a sketch.
- **Future of Tech Idea Journal:** Building on the understanding of innovation, keep a Future of Tech idea journal. Use simple drawings or short notes, stories, or poems to brainstorm small inventions or new ways technology could solve a problem in daily lives or the community.
  - **Concrete Action:** Students regularly add a new invention idea or innovation to their journal.
- **Research a Builder of Tomorrow:** Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on infrastructure, industry, or innovation, either locally or globally. This could be an engineer, an inventor, an architect, or someone who started a sustainable business. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Builder of Tomorrow, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 9. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research and present one Builder of Tomorrow to share with family or the class.

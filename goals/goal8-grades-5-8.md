## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ensuring decent work and economic growth for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 8 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become Work-Story Artists:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a school event, digital portfolio, or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why fair jobs and healthy economic growth matter for everyone.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share their creative work related to decent work and economic growth with at least three people outside of school.
- **Job Shadow and Share:** Inspired by discussions on different jobs and their challenges/solutions, ask a trusted adult about their job. What do they do? What do they like about it? What challenges do they face? How does their work help the community? Then share one interesting fact or feeling about that job with their family or class.
  - **Concrete Action:** Students interview one adult about their job and share one key takeaway.
- **Fairness in My World Audit:** Oberve how fairness relates to work in everyday life. This could be fairness in chores at home, group projects at school, or even observing how local businesses treat their customers and employees.
  - **Concrete Action:** Create a short Fairness in My World observation (drawing, comic, writing, etc.) reflecting on fairness in work around them and how it connects to Global Goal 8.
- **Research a Job Champion:** Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to make jobs fairer, safer, or more inclusive for others, either locally or globally. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Job Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 8. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research and present one Job Champion to share with family or the class.

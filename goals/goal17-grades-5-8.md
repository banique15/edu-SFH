### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 17 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

Become Partnership Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why working together matters for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 17 with at least three people outside of school.
Teamwork Challenge at Home: Take on a Teamwork Challenge at home with a family member. This could be building something together, cooking a meal as a team, or working on a household project. Then, share a photo or write a short paragraph about what made the teamwork successful.
Concrete Action: Students complete a Teamwork Challenge with a family member and share their experience with the class.
Our Community’s Strengths Map: Draw a rough map of the community that highlights different “strengths.” This can be a map that shows local businesses, community gardens, a local library, or other places where people come together. Present this map to family or share with classmates or friends.
Concrete Action: Students create an Our Community’s Strengths map and present it to family, friends, or share in class.
Research a Partnership Hero: Research a real person (from history or today) who has helped bring people together to solve a problem. This could be a community organizer, a diplomat, or a scientist who collaborated with others on a discovery. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Partnership Hero, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 17. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Partnership Hero to share with family or the class.

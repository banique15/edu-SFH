Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in taking urgent action to combat climate and its impacts. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can congtribute to a larger global impact.

Examples:

Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change
Reduce Your Carbon Footprint: Make conscious choices to lesson your individual impact on the environment. This includes turning off lights, unplugging electronics, choosing public transport, biking, or walking when possible, and reducing meat consumption.
Conserve Energy at Home: Help your family reduce energy usage by adjusting thermostats, sealing drafts, and using energy-efficient appliances.
Mindful Consumption: Support businesses that prioritize sustainability and have transparent practices regarding their environmental impact. Choose products with minmal packaging and a long lifespan.
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Consistently practice these habits to minimize waste sent to landfills, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

Plant Trees and Support Green Spaces: Participate in tree-planting initiatives or support local efforts to create and maintain green spaces, which help absorb carbon dioxide.
Talk About Climate Change: Have open and respectful conversations with friends, family, and peers about climate change. Share facts and express your concerns and hopes.
Prepare for Extreme Weather: Learn about emergency preparedness for climate-related hazards relevant to your region (e.g., floods, heatwaves, storms).
Holistic Actions
Awareness and Advocacy (Using Your Voice):
Utilize visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, and/or music to craft impactful works that raise awareness about climate change and inspire action.

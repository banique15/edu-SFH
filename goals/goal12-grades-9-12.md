Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can congtribute to a larger global impact.

Examples:

Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change
Mindful Shopping: Before buying, ask yourself: Do I really need this? Can I borrow it, mend it, or buy it secondhand? Priortize quality over quantity and choose products designed for durability.
Reduce Food Waste: Plan meals, store food properly, and utilize leftovers creatively. Compost food scraps if possible, diverting them from landfills.
Embrace the “4 Rs”: Consistently practice Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Repair. Mend clothes, repurpose containers, and properly sort recyclable items.
Conserve Resources: Be conscious of your water and energy usage at home and school. Turn off lights, unplug chargers, and take shorter showers.
Choose Sustainable Products: When purchasing, look for products with environmental certifications, made from recycled materials, or by companies with transparent sustainable practices.
Support Local and Ethical Businesses: Buy from local producers and businesses that priortize fair labor practices, minimize waste, and use sustainable materials.
Learn About Product Lifecycles: Take time to understand where products come from and where they go after you’re done with them. This awareness fosters more responsible consumption.
Share Knowledge: Talk to friends and family about your sustainable consumption habits and encourage them to adopt similar practices.
Minimize Packaging: Choose products with minimal or recyclable packaging. Bring reusable bags when shopping.
Holistic Actions
Awareness and Advocacy (Using Your Voice):
Utilize visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, and/or music to craft impactful works that raise awareness about unsustainable consumption and production patterns.
Develop informative presentations, workshops, or public awareness campaigns using your artistic creations to educate your peers and community about Global Goal 12 and inspire sustainable lifestyles.
Analyze advertisements critically and create counter-advertisements or satirical pieces that expose unsustainable consumption messages and promote mindful alternatives.
Research local waste management policies, sustainable procurement practices in public institutions, or food waste initiatives. Write letters to local government officials or contribute to public discussions.
Local Engagement and Support (Acting in Your Community):
Lead or participate in school or community waste audits, recycling drives, or composting programs.
Buy local produce to reduce food miles and support sustainable agriculture, simultaneously reducing food loss along supply chains.
Learn and share skills for repairing broken items, promoting reuse and reducing waste.
Identify local companies that are adopting sustainable practices and support them. Offer to help them promote their efforts.
Create educational materials or lead interactive activities in your school or local community to raise awareness about sustainable consumption among various age groups.
Advocate for your school or local organizations to implement sustainable practices for events, such as reducing single-use items, promoting public transport, and managing waste effectively.
Global Citizenship and Learning (Expanding Your Understanding)
Investigate how consumption patterns differ across countries and the associated environmental and social impacts.
Explore how various countries and industries are moving toward a circular economy, where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life.
Learn about global efforts like the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns and international agreements on hazardous waste.
Research best practices in sustainable tourism around the world and how it supports local economies and cultures while minimizing environmental impact.
Learn about advancements in renewable energy technologies in developing countries and how they contribute to more sustainable production.
Research the impact of fossil fuel subsidies globally and their role in encouraging wasteful consumption.

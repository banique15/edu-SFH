## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 5 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become “Fairness” Storytellers:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons (e.g., Emotion Spectrum artwork, a line of dialogue from the Words That Spark Change script, the Fairness Flow Dance, etc.). Share with family friends, or local community groups (like a library reading hour, a scout meeting, or a community center). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why gender equality matters for everyone.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share their creative work related to gender equality with at least three people outside of school.
- **Respect Rules Posters/Campaigns:** Inspired by discussions in the creative writing and drama lessons, design posters or short social media messages (with adult permission, if online) promoting respectful language and actions that challenge gender stereotypes in their school or local community. Focus on messages like “Everyone gets a turn,” “Girls can do anything boys can do, and boys can do anything girls can do,” etc.
  - **Concrete Action:** Organize a Respect Rules poster campaign in the classroom or school hallways to promote positive gender equality messages.
- **Create a Voices for Justice Playlist:** Building on the Fairness Playlist activity, curate a new, longer playlist of songs that specifically highlight themes of gender equality, celebrating uniqueness, or standing up to unfairness. Share this playlist with friends or family, explaining why each song is meaningful for Global Goal 5.
  - **Concrete Action:** Curate a personal playlist and share it with at least one family member or friend, explaining its connection to Global Goal 5.
- **Research a Gender Equality Champion:** Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to make things fairer for girls, boys, women, or men, either locally or globally. Write a short paragraph, draw a picture, or create a brief “movement story” (dance) about this person to share with others.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research and present (either orally, visually, or through movement) one Gender Equality Champion to the class or family members.
- **Fair Play Ambassadors/Games:** Inspired by the Moving Together for Fairness lesson, become Fair Play Ambassadors during recess or in sports. Actively ensure that games are inclusive, that everyone gets a turn, and that all participants are treated with respect, regardless of gender.
  - **Concrete Action:** Commit to being Fair Play Ambassadors during recess for at least one week, focusing on inclusive play.

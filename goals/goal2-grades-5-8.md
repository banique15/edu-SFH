## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agricutlure. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 2 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become a Food Storyteller:** Choose a powerful piece created in the lessons. Share it with family, friends, or local community groups to advocate for safe, nutritious, and sufficient food (Target 2.1). Use art to tell a powerful story about why food is a right, not a privilege.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share your creative work and a fact about local food security with at least three people outside of school.
- **Design a Wasteless Wellness Kit:** Brainstorm practical, creative ideas to reduce food waste at home and school. Design and share a simple visual guide (like an illustrated checklist or short drama skit) focused on improving nutritional needs (Target 2.2) and reducing waste by using leftovers creatively or proper food storage.
  - **Concrete Action:** Design a clear, visual "Wasteless Lunchbox Pledge" or "Leftover Recipe Card" and distribute it to students in your grade or school cafeteria.
- **Research a Global Farming Hero:** Research a real person or group from another country who successfully doubled their agricultural productivity using resilient, innovative, or traditional methods. Write a short paragraph or create a piece of art showing how their success helps feed their community.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research a Global Farming Hero and present their story to your class, focusing on their use of sustainable practices.

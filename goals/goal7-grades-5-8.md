## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ensuring availability and sustainable management of affordable and clean energy for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 7 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become Energy Storytellers:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a library reading hour, a scout meeting, or a community center). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why affordable and clean energy matter for everyone.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share their creative work related to energy with at least three people outside of school.
- **Energy Saving Detectives:** Inspired by discussions on energy challenges and solutions, become Energy Saving Detectives at home. Look for ways to save energy (e.g., turning off the lights, unplugging chargers, taking shorter showers). Then create short, persuasive messages to convince family members to adopt one energy-saving habit.
  - **Concrete Action:** Students identify one energy-saving action at home and try to convince their family to implement it for a week.
- **Clean Energy Vision:** Create a small drawing or collage that illustrates a clean energy solution for the community (e.g., solar panels on the roof, a community garden with solar lights, an electric school bus).
  - **Concrete Action:** Create a Clean Energy Vision artwork for home or neighborhood and share with family or the community.
- **Research a Clean Energy Champion:** Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on clean energy, energy access, or energy conservation, either locally or globally. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Clean Energy Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 7. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research and present one Clean Energy Champion to share with family or the class.

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all, and building strong institutions. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 16 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Peace Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why peace and justice matter for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 16 with at least three people outside of school.
Fairness in My World Audit: Observe how fairnes relates to a peaceful and inclusive society on a personal level, perhaps during a game at recess, in a group project at school, or even at home with a sibling. Write a short limerick or create a simple drawing showing one instance of fairness or unfairness observed, and how it connects to Global Goal 16.
Concrete Action: Students create a short Fairness in My World observation, reflecting on fairness in their own lives.
Strong Institutions Role Play: Building on the exploration of effective institutions, create a short role-play with family or friends that highlights a simple rule or decision and shows how everyone’s voice can be included to make it fair. This could be about a family rule, a school policy, or how a game is played.
Concrete Action: Students practice a short role-play with family members or friends, focusing on a rule and a fair and inclusive way to decide it.
Research a Peace Champion: Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to promote peace, justice, or inclusivity, either locally or globally. This could be a community organizer, a civil rights activist, or a leader who brought people together. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Peace Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 16. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Peace Champion to share with family or the class.

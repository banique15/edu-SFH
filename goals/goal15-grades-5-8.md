Recognize the major threats to life on land, such as deforestation, land degradation (harming the soil), and the extinction of plants and animals. (NCCAS: Cn10.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma)
Understand that protecting and restoring land ecosystems is a shared responsibility that benefits everyone and every living thing. (NCCAS: Cn10.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma)
Discourse

Participate in respectful discussions about land-related challenges and solutions, considering how human actions and choices impact ecosystems. (NCCAS: Re9.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma)
Communicate their own thoughts, feelings, and ideas about Global Goal 15: Life on Land through creative expression in various artistic mediums. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.Ma)
Attitudes

Cultivate a strong sense of personal and collective responsibility for the health of our planet’s land, recognizing that our actions have significant impacts. (NCCAS: Cn11.1.Ma)
Foster a proactive and ethical approach to land stewardship, promoting conservation and restoration efforts in their own communities. (NCCAS: Re9.1.Ma)
Capacity
Develop critical thinking skills by observing and discussing how different artistic elements can represent land-related challenges and solutions. (NCCAS: Re9.1.Ma, Cn10.1.Ma)
Practice collaboration and communication skills through engaging in group art projects, shared writing activities, and coordinated movement, drama, or musical performances to tell stories about life on land. (NCCAS: Cr2.1.Ma, Pr5.1.Ma)
Develop creative expression skills through purposeful experimentation with diverse artistic mediums (visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, music) to communicate their understandings and feelings about life on land. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.Ma)
Action
Identify simple and age-appropriate actions they can take to protect local ecosystems, conserve natural resources, and support land-friendly practices in their daily lives. (NCCAS: Pr6.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma)
Participate in collaborative artistic projects that creatively express messages of hope and support for life on land. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.Ma, Pr6.1.Ma)
Reflect on their personal role in contributing to a healthier planet, fostering a sense of responsible global citizenship. (NCCAS: Re9.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma)

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 15 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Land Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows arto to be utilized to tell a powerful story about why protecting the land and its biodiversity matters for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 15 with at least three people outside of school.
Local Land Audit: Become Land Auditors in the neighborhood (with adult supervision, if necessary). Safely look for examples of biodiversity (plants, animals, insects), signs of land degradation (litter, dry patches), or areas that could be improved. Then, create a sketch or write a short poem about one example that was found and its connection to Global Goal 15.
Concrete Action: Students explore their local natural spaces and identify one example of a healthy ecosystem or a challenge to document with a sketch or short writing piece.
Rhythm of Restoration Performance: Teach the Rhythm of Restoration to family members or friends. Perform the piece using natural or recycled objects as instruments to highlight the harmonious sound of a healthy ecosystem and the power of community action.
Concrete Action: Students teach a Rhythm of Restoration to at least two people outside of the classroom
Research an Nature Champion: Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on protecting ecosystems, fighting deforestation, or restoring land. This could be a conservationist, an indigenous leader, a scientist, or a community activist. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Nature Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 15. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Nature Champion to share with family or the class.

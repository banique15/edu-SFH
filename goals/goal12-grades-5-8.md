Understand that our choices about what we use and throw away have an impact on the environment and that resources are limited. (Cn10.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma) 
Discourse

Cultivate a sense of optimism and initiative towards finding and implementing creative solutions for waste and pollution in their schools and communities. (Re9.1.Ma) 
Capacity
Develop critical thinking skills by observing and discussing how different artistic elements can represent challenges, processes, and solutions related to consumption and production. (Re9.1.Ma, Cn10.1.Ma)

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 12 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Sunstainability Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why being smart with what we use and throw away matters for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 12 with at least three people outside of school.
Waste to Wonder Challenge: Find one item at home that would normally be thrown away (e.g., a plastic bottle, box, old sock, etc.) and turn it into something new and useful. Share a photo of this useful object with family or friends, explaining its new purpose.
Concrete Action: Students transform one piece of waste into a useful object and share their creation.
Consumption Audit and Action Plan: Choose one common item (water bottles, paper towels, food waste) and track how much is used in the household. At the end of a week, use the findings to write a short, persuasive message or create a drawing with a plan to reduce, reuse, or recycle that item more effectively.
Concrete Action: Students track one type of waste at home for a week and create a plan to reduce it.
Research a Sustainability Hero: Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to reduce waste, invent a sustainable product, or educate others about responsible consumption. This could be a local recycler, an environmental activist, or a sustainable business owner. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Sustainability Hero, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 12. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Sustainability Hero to share with family or the class.

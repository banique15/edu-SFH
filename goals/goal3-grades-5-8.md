Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 3 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become a Wellbeing Messenger:** Choose a powerful piece created in the lessons. Share it with family, friends, or a school club to advocate for mental health and well-being. Use art to tell a powerful story about the importance of talking about feelings.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share your creative work and three healthy coping strategies with at least three people outside of school.
- **Design a Global Health Hero Profile:** Research a real person (a doctor, scientist, community health worker, or activist) who helped reduce the burden of a preventable disease like malaria or tuberculosis, or who improved maternal/child health in a developing country. Write a short paragraph or create a dramatic monologue detailing their contribution.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research a Global Health Hero and present their story, focusing on the specific disease or health issue they addressed.
- **Launch a Safety Signage Art Contest:** Create an art contest for younger students to design clear, creative, and attention-grabbing safety signs (e.g., "Slow Down Near School Zone," "Safe Storage of Cleaning Supplies").
  - **Concrete Action:** Organize a simple Safety Signage Contest and display the winning designs in high-traffic areas of your school or local community center.
- **Create a Positive Practices Playlist:** Inspired by the "Healthy Beats" lesson, curate a shared playlist of songs (or write new song verses) that promote positive prevention and treatment behaviors related to exercise or emotional regulation. Share the playlist with the class or school library.
  - **Concrete Action:** Create and share a themed "Positive Practices Playlist" with at least ten songs that clearly relate to mental well-being or healthy choices.

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 14 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Ocean Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why a healthy ocean matters for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 14 with at least three people outside of school.
Trash Tracker & Art Project: Become Trash Trackers for a week by safely tracking the types of trash found around neighborhoods, schools, and homes. At the end of the week, use the findings to create an art piece or write a short paragraph about the discovery and its connection to Global Goal 14.
Concrete Action: Students track a type of waste they encounter for a week and create a visual or written piece about it and its connection to Global Goal 14.
Awareness Jingle: Refine one jingle about ocean conservation from the activity, then teach it to family, friends, younger siblings, or even record a performance of it to share (with parent permission).
Concrete Action: Students create and teach an Ocean’s Call jingle to at least two people outside of the classroom.
Research an Ocean Champion: Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on ocean conservation. This could be a marine biologist, a scuba diver who cleans reefs, an activist, or an inventor. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Ocean Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 14. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Ocean Champion to share with family or the class.

## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 6 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become “Fairness” Storytellers:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a library reading hour, a scout meeting, or a community center). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why clean water and good sanitation matter for everyone.
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share their creative work related to water and sanitation with at least three people outside of school.
- **Design Water-Wise Reminders:** Inspired by the art, creative writing, and music lessons, design simple, colorful posters or short jingles for school bathrooms or at home. These reminders can encourage actions like “Turn off the faucet!”, “Short showers save water!”, or “Wash your hands with soap!”
  - **Concrete Action:** Create and place Water-Wise Reminders in relevant locations at home or school.
- **Local Water Check:** Investigate a local water source (like a nearby creek, pond, or even storm drain) safely. Then, create an art piece or descriptive writing piece to show what the water looks like, sounds like, and what feelings it evokes. This can help them connect to Target 6.3 (improving water quality) and Target 6.6 (protecting ecosystems).
  - **Concrete Action:** Observe a local water source and create a Local Water Check artwork or writing piece to share with the class or a friend.
- **Research a Water Champion:** Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on access to clean water, sanitation, or water conservation, either locally or globally. Then, write a short paragraph, draw a picture, or create a short presentation about this Water Champion, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 6.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research and present one Water Champion to share with family or the class.

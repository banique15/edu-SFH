## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change
- Reduce Food Waste at Home: Be mindful of portion sizes, store food properly to extend its shelf life, and get creative with leftovers. This directly impacts target 2.1 and 2.c.
- Compost Food Scraps: If possible, compost organic waste. This enriches soil for gardening and reduces landfill waste, contributing to sustainable practices.
- Make Informed Food Choices: Learn about where your food comes from. Choose seasonal and locally grown produce when available to support local farmers and reduce the carbon footprint of transportation.
- Understand Nutritional Needs: Pay attention to balanced meals and healthy eating habits. This can improve your own nutrition and help you understand the importance of target 2.2.
- Read Food Labels: Become familiar with nutritional information and ingredients. This can help you make healthier choices and understand the broader implications of food production.
- Value All Food: Appreciate the effort and resources that go into producing food. Avoid wasting food and encourage others to do the same.
- Grow Something: Even a small herb garden or a few vegetables in pots can help you understand the process of food production and the importance of healthy soil.
- Share Knowledge: If you learn an interesting fact about food security or sustainable agriculture, share it with friends or family to raise awareness.
- Support Farmers: Look for ways to support small-scale food producers, such as visiting farmers’ markets or choosing products from local farms.
- Be Mindful of Water Usage: Water is a critical resource for agriculture. Be conscious of your water consumption at home, contributing to sustainable resource management.

### Holistic Actions

#### Awareness and Advocacy (Using Your Voice)
- Use your artistic skills (drawing, painting, collage, creating writing, dance, music, drama) to create impactful pieces that depict the challenges of hunger and the hope for food security. Display them in school, share online, or in local community spaces.
- Organize short educational sessions during lunch, club meetings, or in class to discuss the various dimensions or hunger, its causes, and potential solutions, using information from reputable sources like the UN or World Food Programme (WFP).
- Research policy issues related to food security (e.g., food waste legislation, support for small farmers, international aid for hunger relief) and write letters to elected officials or participate in online petitions.

#### Local Engagement and Support (Acting in Your Community)
- Dedicate time to volunteering at local food banks, soup kitchens, or community pantries. This directly helps ensure access to safe, nutritious food for vulnerable populations.
- Lead collection drives for non-perishable food items or fresh product (if feasible and with proper storage) within your school or community to donate to local organizations.
- Get involved with local community gardens or urban agriculture initiatives. This promotes sustainable food production and can provide fresh produce to those in need.
- Visit local farmers’ markets, learn about sustainable farming practices from local growers, and consider supporting Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs.

#### Global Citizenship and Learning (Expanding Your Understanding)
- Investigate regions of the world most affected by hunger and the specific factors contributing to food insecurity (e.g., conflict, climate change, economic instability).
- Learn about innovative farming techniques being developed globally that address climate change, improve soil quality, and increase productivity sustainably.
- Learn about how global trade policies and international development aid impact food security in different countries.
- Regularly check for news and updates from international organizations like the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), or Action Against Hunger to stay informed about global efforts to achieve Zero Hunger.
- Explore how communities around the world are building resilience into their food systems to better withstand shocks like natural disasters and economic crises.

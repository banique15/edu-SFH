Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can congtribute to a larger global impact.

Examples:

Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change
Reduce Plastic Consumption: Consciously minimize your use of single-use plastics (bags, bottles, straws, packaging). Opt for reusable alternatives. Every piece of plastic kept out of the environment is a victory for the ocean.
Dispose of Waste Properly: Ensure all waste, especially hazardous materials, is disposed of correctly and never put down drains or flushed down toilets. This prevents land-based pollution from reaching waterways and the ocean.
Be a Responsible Seafood Consumer: If you eat seafood, research sustainable fishing practices and choose seafood that is certified as sustainably sourced. Avoid purchasing species that are overfished or caught using destructive methods.
Conserve Water: Reduce your water usage at home. Less water used means less wastewater eventually making its way back to marine environments.
Reduce Chemical Runoff: Be mindful of the chemicals you use in your home and garden. Choose eco-friendly cleaning products and avoid over-fertilizing lawns to prevent nutrient pollution.
Support Ocean-Friendly Businesses: Prioritize businesses that demonstrate a commitment to ocean conservation, sustainable practices, and ethical sourcing of marine products.
Educate Yourself and Others: Learn about the impacts of ocean acidification, marine debris, and overfishing. Share this knowledge with friends and family.
Participate in Beach/Waterway Cleanups: Even if you don’t live near a coast, participating in local rivier, lake, or park cleanups helps prevent litter from reaching the ocean.
Holistic Actions
Awareness and Advocacy (Using Your Voice):
Utilize visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, and/or music to produce impactful pieces that raise awareness about ocean pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification, and/or the beauty of marine biodiversity.
Prepare and deliver informative presentations or workshops, incorporating the creative elements from the lessons, to educate your peers and community about Global Goal 14 and inspire ocean conservation.
Use your artistic voice to satirize or highlight the absurdity of unsustainable fishing practices, excessive plastic use, or disregard for marine ecosystems.
Research local, national, or international policies related to marine protected areas, fisheries management, or pollution control. Write letters to government officials, or participate in campaigns advocating for stronger ocean protection laws.

Local Engagement and Support (Acting in Your Community):
Join or organize local beach, river, lake, or park cleanups. Document the types of pollution found to raise awareness about local sources of marine debris.
Volunteer or donate to local organizations focused on marine conservation, aquatic ecosystem restoration, or environmental education.
In your community, advocate for solutions that reduce land-based pollution reaching waterways, such as improved stormwater management, wastewater treatment, or green infrastructure projects.
Work with your school or local community to create public art installations using recycled materials, especially ocean plastic, to visually represent the impact of pollution and inspire action.
If in a coastal community, learn about local small-scale artisanal fisheries and consider how to support their sustainable practices.
Global Citizenship and Learning (Expanding Your Understanding)
Research the extent of ocean pollution, the impacts of illegal fishing, and the consequences of ocean acidification globally.
Explore successful marine protected areas around the world and understand their role in conserving biodiversity and restoring fish stocks.
Research the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international agreements that provide the legal framework for ocean governance.
Stay informed about advancements in marine scientific research and technology that help us understand and protect the oceans.
Investigate how Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are leveraging sustainable tourism and fisheries to create economic benefits while protecting marine resources.
Learn about and support organizations working on a global scale to combat marine pollution, overfishing, and ocean acidification.

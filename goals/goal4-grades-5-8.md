## Action Planning

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of inclusive and equitable quality education for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 4 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom

- **Become Education Storytellers:** Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons (e.g., School of Tomorrow artwork, a powerful sentence from the stream of consciousness writing, recording of the Education Anthem). Share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a library reading hour, a scout meeting, or community center). This allows you to tell a powerful story with your art about why quality education matters for everyone
  - **Concrete Action:** Aim to share your creative work with at least three people outside of school.
- **Design a Kindness Kit for Schools:** Brainstorm practical items that could make a new student feel welcome or create a calm space in a classroom. Collect or create some of these items to donate to new students in your own school or a local elementary school.
  - **Concrete Action:** Organize a Kindness Kit drive in your classroom or school to collect items for new students.
- **Our Community’s Learning Map:** Create a map (physical or digital) of all the places in your community where people can learn, beyond just your school. This could include the library, museums, parks, community centers, or even local businesses. This helps to see lifelong learning opportunities around you and appreciate diverse learning spaces (connect to Target 4.1 and 4.a).
  - **Concrete Action:** Create a Community Learning Map to share with family, friends, or display in a public space, like the school lobby or local community center board.
- **Research a Global Learning Hero:** Research a real person from another country who faced challenges to get an education, or who helped others get an education. Write a short paragraph or draw a picture of this Global Learning Hero, explaining how their story connects to Global Goal 4 (link to Targets 4.1 and 4.5). This expands understanding of global education disparities and triumphs.
  - **Concrete Action:** Research a Global Learning Hero and present your findings to family, your class, or someone in the community.
- **Launch a School Supply Swap:** Inspired by the idea of ensuring everyone has enough to learn with (Target 4.1), organize a School Supply Swap, event at school or in your neighborhood/community. Students can bring in gently used school supplies they no longer need and swap them for items they do, or donate extra supplies to a local charity.
  - **Concrete Action:** Plan and execute a School Supply Swap event once a year to redistribute usable school materials.

Develop advanced critical thinking skills to thoroughly analyze the root causes of environmental degredation (e.g., deforestation, unsustainable agriculture) and to critically evaluate the effectiveness and ethical implications of various proposed solutions for ecosystem restoration and protection. (NCCAS: Re9.1.la, Cn10.1.la) 
Gain a deeper understanding of the unique and powerful role of the arts in promoting critical awareness, fostering empathy, inspiring action, and nurturing a cultural shift towards sustainable interactions with life on land. (NCCAS: Cn11.1.la) 
Strengthen their ability to translate complex environmental concepts (e.g., biodiversity loss, desertification) into concrete and impactful artistic expressions across visual, textual, kinetic, and auditory mediums. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.la) 
Action
Identify and age-appropriate and impactful actions they can take to reduce their impact on terrestrial ecosystems and promote sustainable practices in their daily lives, schools, and communities. (NCCAS: Pr6.1.la, Cn11.1.la) 
Explore and develop meaningful ways to contribute to conservation efforts, advocate for policies that protect life on land, and support initiatives aimed at ecosystem restoration and biodiversity preservation. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.la, Pr6.1.la) 
Use their chosen art form as a powerful tool for advocacy, raising awareness about the importance of protecting and restoring terrestrial ecosystems, and inspiring positive change in attitudes and behaviors. (NCCAS: Pr6.1.la) 
Reflect thoughtfully on their individual and collective role in creating a more sustainable and equitable world for all life on Earth, fostering a sense of sustained engagement and responsible global citizenship. (NCCAS: Re9.1.la, Cn11.1.la) 

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting and reversing land degradation and biodiversity loss. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions can congtribute to a larger global impact.

Examples:

Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change
Support Sustainable Products: Choose products that are sustainably sourced, such as certified wood or paper products, or items that do not contribute to deforestation or habitat destruction.
Reduce Your Ecological Footprint: Be mindful of your consumption patterns, as everything we buy has an impact on land. Reduce waste, recycyle, and reuse to lesson demand on natural resources.
Conserve Water and Energy: Use water and energy efficiently at home and school. This reduces the strain on ecosystems that provide these resources and minimizes pollution from energy production.
Learn About Local Ecosystems: Understand the plants and animals native to your area. Support efforts to protect and restore local natural habitats.
Avoid Invasive Species: Be aware of common invasive plant and animal species in your region and avoid planting or releasing them. Learn how to identify and report them if necessary.
Be a Responsible Outdoor Enthusiast: If you spend time in nature, follow “Leave No Trace” principles. Stay on marked trails, pack out all trash, and respect wildlife.
Support Local Conservation Efforts: Look for opportunities to help protect and restore local parks, forests, or wetlands.
Reduce Waste from Food: Food waste often ends up in landfills, contributing to land degradation. Reduce food waste and compost organic materials if possible.
Spread the Word: Share facts and stories about the importance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems with your friends, family, and online community.
Holistic Actions
Awareness and Advocacy (Using Your Voice):
Utilize visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, and/or music to produce impactful pieces that raise awareness about deforestation, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and/or the beauty of terrestrial ecosystems.
Prepare and deliver informative presentations or workshops, incorporating the creative elements from the lessons, to educate your peers and community about Global Goal 15 and inspire land stewardship.
Use documentary theater or creative writing to share real-world stories and perspectives of communities impacted by land degradation or involved in conservation efforts, including indigenous voices.
Research local, national, or international policies related to forest management, protected areas, combating desertification, or preventing poaching. Write letters to government officials or participate in campaigns advocating for stronger land protection laws.
Local Engagement and Support (Acting in Your Community):
Join or organize tree-planting events or initiatives to restore degraded lands in your community or local natural areas.
Connect with local land trusts, nature centers, or environmental organizations that work to protect and restore terrestrial ecosystems.
If available, support farmers who use sustainable agricultural methods that protect soil health and biodiversity.
Participate in community efforts to identify and remove invasive alien species from local parks, forests, or wetlands.
Get involved in projects that create urban gardens, pollinator habitats, or other green spaces that promote biodiversity in your neighborhood.
Support efforts to establish or expand protected areas in your region to conserve important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity.
Global Citizenship and Learning (Expanding Your Understanding)

Discover areas globally with exceptionally high biodiversity that are also under significant threat, and the conservation efforts underway there.
Learn about international efforts and best practices for sustainable forest management and combating deforestation.
Research the importance of genetic resources for biodiversity and the ethical considerations around their utilization and fair sharing.

Explore the concept of achieving a land degradation-neutral world by 2030 and what global initiatives are working towards this goal.
Learn about the traditional ecological knowledge and sustainable practices of indigenous communities worldwide, and advocate for their rights and involvement in conservation.
Stay informed about major international agreements and initiatives focused on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration.

Practice collaboration and communication skills through engaging in group art projects, shared writing, and coordinated movement, drama, or musical performances to tell stories about climate action. (NCCAS: Cr2.1.Ma, Pr5.1.Ma) 
Develop creative expression skills through purposeful experimentation with diverse artistic mediums (visual art, creative writing, dance, drama, music) to communicate their understandings and feelings about Climate Action. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.Ma) 
Action
Identify simple and age-appropriate actions they can take to reduce their own impact on the planet and promote climate-friendly practices in their daily lives, schools, and homes. (NCCAS: Pr6.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma) 
Participate in collaborative artistic projects that creatively express messages of hope and support for climate action. (NCCAS: Cr3.1.Ma, Pr6.1.Ma) 
Reflect on their personal role in contributing to a healthier planet, fostering a sense of responsible global citizenship. (NCCAS: Re9.1.Ma, Cn11.1.Ma) 

Action Planning
Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

### Examples
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 13 in their wider community and beyond.

### Taking Action Beyond the Classroom
Become Climate Storytellers: Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a neighborhood association or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why taking climate action matters for everyone.
Concrete Action: Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 12 with at least three people outside of school.
Waste to Wonder Challenge: Find one item at home that would normally be thrown away (e.g., a plastic bottle, box, old sock, etc.) and turn it into something new and useful. Share a photo of this useful object with family or friends, explaining its new purpose.
Concrete Action: Students transform one piece of waste into a useful object and share their creation.
Climate Action Checklist: Create a simple, eye-catching Climate Action Checklist at home. It can include things like “Turn off lights when leaving a room,” “Unplug chargers when they’re not in use,” or “Plant a tree.” Use artistic skills to make it visually appealing, and present it to family and friends.
Concrete Action: Students create a Climate Action Checklist for their home and present it to their family/friends to encourage climate-friendly actions.
Research a Climate Change Hero: Research a real person (from history or today) who has made a significant positive impact on climate change. This could be a scientist, a community activist, or an inventor. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Climate Change Hero, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 13. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.
Concrete Action: Students research and present one Climate Change Hero to share with family or the class.
Eco-Inventors Journal: Keep a journal at home where drawings or short stories can be used to brainstorm solutions to climate problems. These can be about a new invention, a smarter way to recycle, or a creative way to use less energy.
Concrete Action: Students create an Eco-Inventors Journal and create entries at least once a week about creative solutions to climate change.

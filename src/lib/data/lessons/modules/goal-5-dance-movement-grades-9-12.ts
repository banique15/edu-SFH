	introduction: "Start by asking students, How does water make you feel?  \n\tAllow a few moments of quiet reflection, then invite them to share their thoughts and feelings with the class.  \n\tBriefly explain the concept of movement choirs, where a group of people create a unified performance through synchroized movements and gestures, often incorporating spoken word or vocalization.\n\n* Simple Explanation: Imagine a group of people moving together, like a chorus, but instead of singing they’re using their bodies to express ideas and emotions. That’s the essence of a movement choir.  \n* Key Features  \n  * *Synchronized Movement:* Everyone moves together, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.  \n  * *Expressive Gestures:* Using body language and facial expressions to convey emotions and ideas.  \n  * *Spoken Word or Vocalization:* Sometimes, words or sounds are incorporated to add another layer of meaning.  \n  * *Accessibility:* No prior dance experience is required; anyone can participate and contribute their own movement style.\n\n\t[Video example of movement choir.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDRXWCa0r2w)  \n\tRe-introduce Global Goal 6 if necessary: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.  \n\tHighlight the importance of water for human health, ecosystems, and the planet’s well-being.\n\n* *Human Health:* Hydration, hygiene, sanitation, growing food.  \n* *Ecosystems:* Supporting diverse plant and animal life, maintaining natural balance.  \n* *The Planet:* Regulating climate, shaping landscapes, providing resources for industries and communities.\n\n\tConnect this to student’s lives, asking questions to make it personal, such as:\n\n* How much water do you think you use in a day? Where does it come from?  \n* Can you imagine life without clean water to drink or wash with?  \n* How do you think water pollution affects the environment and the creatures that live in it?\n\n\tExplain how movement choirs can be a powerful tool for expressing the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with water-related issues.\n\n* *Emotional Connection,* movement choirs can help us:  \n  * Express the emotions associated with water issues \\- joy, gratitude, anger, fear, hope.  \n  * Embody the challenges of water scarcity or pollution through movement.  \n  * Envision solutions and express the power of collective action through synchronized movement and collaborative choreography.  \n  * Imagine a group of people moving like a flowing river, representing the abundance and life-giving properties of water. Or, picture them huddled together, their bodies tense and constricted, symbolizing the struggle for access to clean water in a drought-striken region.",

    "content": "Divide students into groups of 4-8. Assign each group one of the Global Goal 6 targets.  \n\tGive each group a simplified version of Global Goal 6 targets.  \n\tHelp students understand the challenge facing their goal/target, asking questions such as:\n\n* What’s the problem this goal/target is trying to solve? Who’s affected? Where in the world is this happening?\n\n\tLead students through a movement (and sound) brainstorm, asking leading questions such as:\n\n* What body shapes/actions show this struggle (e.g., hunched over for water scarcity, frantic scrubbing for pollution)  \n* Are there any literal gestures? (e.g., turning a faucet, washing hands)\n\n  If utilizing sound\n\n* What sounds represent this issue? (e.g., dripping for leaks, machinery for industrial pollution)  \n* Can voices by used? (e.g., whispers for lack of access, chants for protest)\n\n\tGuide groups to think about how the movement (and sound) can change to show progress towards the target."

    "title": "Choreography and Rehearsal",
    "content": "Suggest a simple structure\n\n* Beginning (problem)  \n* Middle (struggle/action)  \n* End (solution/hope)\n\n\tCommunicate to students that the movement choir choreography should be 1-2 minutes long, so key moments should be prioritized.  \n\tHelp students focus on movement elements, such as:\n\n* *Unison vs. Contrast*  \n  * Some parts can be everyone doing the same thing, others can have subgroups doing different but complementary movements to show complexity.  \n* *Spatial Patterns*  \n  * Circles can show community, lines can show journeys, clusters can represent crowding/lack of resources.  \n* *Facial Expressions*  \n  * These are essential in conveying emotion without words.\n\n\t\tIf using sound integration\n\n* *Vocalizations*  \n  * Can be literal words, chants, or abstract sounds to create atmosphere.\n\n\tDuring choreography creation, remind students that the goal is expression, not perfection.  \n\tExample Prompts\n\n* *6.1 \\- Access to Water*  \n  * *Start:* Group huddled low, hands cupped as if thirsty.  \n  * *Middle:* Frantic searching, maybe someone collapses from exhaustion.  \n  * *End:* Eruption of joy as “water” is found/brought in, shared with relief.  \n* *6.2 \\- Sanitation*  \n  * *Start:* Chaotic movement, covering noses, showing discomfort.  \n  * *Middle:* Orderly lines forming, miming handwashing, building a latrine.  \n  * *End:* Proud stances, clean faces, maybe a “tableau” of a healthy community.  \n* *6.3 \\- Water Quality*  \n  * *Start:* Slow, sluggish movements, showing contamination.  \n  * *Middle:* Energetic scrubbing, filtering motions, purifying the “water”.  \n  * *End:* Flowing, joyful movements, mirroring clean water, maybe bird sounds added vocally (if using sound).  \n* *6.4 \\- Water Efficiency*  \n  * *Start:* Restricted, tight movements, showing scarcity, maybe a “plant” wilting.  \n  * *Middle:* Careful, precise gestures of collecting/conserving (cupped hands, small steps).  \n  * *End:* Growth\\! Plant revives, movements become more expansive, showing abundance achieved through mindful use.  \n* *6.5 \\- Integrated Water Management*  \n  * *Start:* Groups facing off, tense postures, maybe conflicted sounds/chants (if using sound).  \n  * *Middle:* Negotiation, coming together, forming a circle or linked shape.  \n  * *End:* Harmonious movement, all contributed to a shared goals (e.g., building something together).  \n* *6.6 \\- Ecosystems*  \n  * *Start:* Disjointed, chaotic movements, represented a damaged ecosystem.  \n  * *Middle:* Nurturing gestures, planting, cleaning, protecting.  \n  * *End:* Flourishing, interconnected movements, representing a restored ecosystem.  \n* *6.a \\- International Cooperation*  \n  * *Start:* Isolated groups, showing need but unable to help each other.  \n  * *Middle:* Reaching out, connecting, sharing of resources.  \n  * *End:* Unified movement, showing the strength of collaboration.  \n* *6.b \\- Community Participation*  \n  * *Start:* Individual movements, showing lack of unity.  \n  * *Middle:* Coming together, forming a group, raising voices (literally or through movement).  \n  * *End:* Powerful, collective movement, demonstrating community strength."

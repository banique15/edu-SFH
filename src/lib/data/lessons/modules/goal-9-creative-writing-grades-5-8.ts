	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 9, Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.  \nClarify that Global Goal 9 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to help communities and countries build strong, lasting things (like safe roads, schools, and hospitals) \\- that’s infrastructure. Emphasize it’s also about new ideas and inventions that make life better \\- that’s innovation. And it’s about making sure industries (where things are made) are fair and sustainable, helping everyone grow \\- that’s industry. Basically, it’s about building a better, smarter world for everyone.  \nShare a compelling image, video, or short news clip related to Global Goal 9\\.  \nExamples:\n\n* A time-lapse video of a bridge being built.  \n  * [Watch time-lapse video of new Goethals Bridge being built](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki818dHeito)  \n  * [Timelapse shows construction of $4 billion Hudson River Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BC5GmT--I8)  \n* An image of a wind turbine farm generating clean energy.  \n  * [Images](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f620f31ac399600c&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&q=An+image+of+a+wind+turbine+farm+generating+clean+energy.&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3JyWp6w6_rxLPe8F8fpm5a57-gjtOlil4ICv8960VBJ2-tNhcM42qtSIy_4o_ZR8MTul_z-_bBkov4oy3_bdb2RhtUK0NN3m-eN9Lfa0Efw5ciAOmSXDADHcIoIC37eh7jR4bmKEG9jv_-ghnO_H2NbB1vHtP3T8y9pWqcI3lNnTLeZcfog&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwuPXDjsaKAxVQMtAFHaLIFMkQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=1200&bih=728&dpr=2)  \n* A news report about a new technological innovation.  \n  * [New artificial intelligence innovations changing the world of technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qdb223-nsI)  \n  * [How China is Using Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMLsHI8aV0g)\n\nOpen a conversation with guiding questions like:\n\n* What is happening in this image/video/news clip? What do you see being built or invented?  \n* What challenges or opportunities do you think this technology or structure helps with?  \n* How does this relate to the idea of building a better, smarter world for everyone?  \n* What do you think is the coolest new invention you’ve ever heard of?\n\nIntroduce Flash Fiction. Explain that Flash Fiction is like writing a very, very short story, but every single word is important because you only have a tiny space to tell a big idea. Clarify that it’s like taking a quick photo with words, focusing on one moment or one big idea. Tell students that even though this kind of writing is short, it can make a huge impact.  \nShow selected examples of Flash Fiction and discuss their brevity and impact.  \nExamples:\n\n* “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”    \n  * This classic six-word story misattributed to  Ernest Hemingway demonstrates the power of brevity and implication. [More information on this story.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_sale:_baby_shoes,_never_worn)  \n* “The Last Man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.” \\- By Fredric Brown  \n  * This is a fantastic example of a surprising twist or turning point. It sets up one idea (loneliness) then completely flips it with the unexpected knock, leaving the readers with a powerful question.  \n* “The world ended. Luckily, my pet rock survived.”  \n  * This is a modern, often shared example from online flash fiction communities. It’s funny but also shows how even a tiny story can have a problem and solution or a unique perspective.  \n* “A girl woke up. Her legs were roots. Her arms, branches. She smiled. Sunlight warmed her leaves.”  \n  * This type of transformative flash fiction is common. It uses strong imagery and a clear sense of change within a very short space.\n\nDiscuss the example(s) with guiding questions like:\n\n* What do you notice about how short these stories are?  \n* How do they still make you think or feel something big?\n\nGuide students through exploring the important elements of Flash Fiction.\n\n* *Brevity; every word counts:* In Flash Fiction, every word is important \\- be choosy about which you use.  \n  * Ask: If you only had ten words to tell a story about building a super bridge, which ten would you choose?  \n    * Have students brainstorm ideas for a few moments.  \n  * Ask: How can you make every word count in your writing? What are some strategies for creating a strong impact with limited space? (e.g., strong verbs, interesting nouns, focusing on one moment, no wasted words).  \n* *Impactful Language; paint with words:* Good Flash Fiction uses strong verbs and vivid descriptions to paint a picture in the reader’s mind, making them see and feel the story.  \n  * Ask: If you want to describe a noisy factory, would you say “The factory was loud” or “Machines roared, metal clanged, sparks flew”? Which sounds more exciting?  \n  * Ask: How can you use powerful words to create a specific mood (e.g., busy, calm, excited, worried) or to make the reader feel like they are right there in the middle of your story? (e.g., use words that show feelings, use words that describe how things look/sound/feel).  \n* *Turning Points; the unexpected spark:* Even in a very short story, there can be a “turning point” or an “unexpected spark” that changes everything. It’s like a surprise that makes the story interesting.  \n  * Ask: In a story about building a road, what’s a small, unexpected thing that could happen that changes the whole plan? (e.g., finding a giant rock, a new invention shows up, an animal blocks the path).  \n  * Ask: How can a small change make a big difference in a short story?  \n* Emphasize that even though Flash Fiction is short, it can explore big ideas about building, inventing, and growing.",

A short story will be started (just a few words), and then passed around and 1-3 words will be added to continue the story. This process will continue, with the story being passed around the entire class.  \n*Story Start*\n\n* Start with a simple phrase that can begin a story (teacher should start the first round). (e.g., “The robot woke up…”)\n\n*Add and Pass*\n\n* Instruct the next student to add 1-3 words to continue the story, then make eye contact with the next student. They continue this, adding 1-3 words to build the story each time.  \n  Example Sequence:  \n  * *Teacher:* The robot woke up…  \n  * *Student 1:* …and stretched its…  \n  * *Student 2:* …shiny metal arms.  \n  * *Student 3:* …It saw a…  \n  * *Student 4:* new invention.  \n  * *Student 5:* A light flashed…  \n  * *Student 6:* …and then…  \n  * *Student 7:* …the whole city…  \n  * *Student 8:* …began to fly\\!  \n* Guide the story around the class for 2-3 sentences, then start a new story chain to get more ideas flowing.\n\nConclude by affirming the students’ quick thinking and ability to build stories concisely, skills vital for Flash Fiction."

    "content": "Explain to the class that each individual student will now choose one Story Spark from their group’s ideas (or create their own) to write their own Flash Fiction story.  \nThe story should be around 100-200 words or 1-2 paragraphs, so remind the class that every word counts.  \nInstruct students to focus on:\n\n* *Brevity:* Keep it short and focus on one powerful moment or idea.  \n* *Impactful Language:* Use strong verbs and vivid descriptions to paint a picture in the reader’s mind.  \n* *Show, Don’t Tell:* Instead of saying “The machine was loud,” describe how it “roared” or “clanked”.  \n* *Turning Point:* Can they include a small, unexpected change or a new idea that sparks a solution?\n\nEncourage students to write about:\n\n* A new invention solving a problem.  \n* Building a strong, resilient structure (like a bridge or school).  \n* A factory becoming cleaner and safer.  \n* A challenge with technology or infrastructure, and how it changes.  \n* A person working hard and feeling proud in a fair job.\n\nCirculate, offering support and guidance as students write. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* How can you make the sound of that noisy factory really come alive in just a few words?  \n* What’s the most important feeling you want your readers to have when they read your story?  \n* Can you find a really strong verb to describe how your invention works?  \n* What’s the one thing that changes in your story?  \n* Are you telling a story about building, or inventing, or industries from Global Goal 9?"

    "title": "Sharing and Discussion",
    "content": "Explain that students will now share their Flash Fiction stories.  \nThis can be done through volunteer readings, or have students pair up to read their stories to each other.  \nFacilitate a class discussion about the stories, focusing on the connection to Global goal 9 and the effectiveness of the Flash Fiction techniques. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* What was one of the most impactful or memorable stories you heard/read? What made it stand out?  \n* How did these very short stories make you think differently about Global Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)?  \n* What were some of the common themes (e.g., new ideas, building things, problems at work, clever solutions) you noticed in the stories?  \n* How did the authors use strong verbs or vivid descriptions to create an engaging and thought-provoking narratives in such a short space?  \n* Did any story show a surprising or unexpected change? How did that affect your interpretation of the story?  \n* What did you learn about the power of using just a few carefully chosen words to tell a big story about important ideas?  \n* Did any story inspire you to learn more about a particular invention, type of building, or technology?"

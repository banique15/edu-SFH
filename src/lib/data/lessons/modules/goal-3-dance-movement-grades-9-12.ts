Examples:\n\n* *Circle Stretches:* Have students form a circle, holding hands. Gentlys way side to side, mimicking the swaying motion often seen in folk dances. Then, raise arms overhead and reach for the sky, feeling a stretch in the sides of the body.  \n* *Footwork Prep:* With feet shoulder-width apart, practice stepping side to side, then add a heel-toe tap in front. This mimics basic steps seen in dances like Irish jigs or the Kolo.  \n* *Grapevine:* Teach the basic grapevine step (step side, cross behind, step side) and have students practice it moving across the room. This is a common step in various folk dances.  \n* *Partnered Folk Dances:* In pairs, students face each other and gently swing their joined hands back and forth, or try a simple do-si-do (passing each other right shoulder to right shoulder, then back to back, then left to left). This warms up the body and builds connection for partnered folk dances\n\n\tPlay examples of the music that will accompany the chosen dance to familiarize students with the rhythms and styles."

	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use their voices and the power of songs to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.  \nClarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. You explain that it’s baout making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.  \nExplain that music has always been a powerful tool for this message. Introduce the characteristics of Folk Music. Clarify that folk music is often simple, and it’s music from the people. Explain that it’s often passed down from person to person and tells stories about everyday life, struggles, and the hope for a better, fairer world. Explain that folk music has been used throughout history as a way for people to have a voice and to come together to work for change.  \nShow images or video clips of folk singers or people singing together, or play a few simple folk song examples.  \nExamples:  \nVideo\n\n* [“This Land is Your Land”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaI5IRuS2aE)*,* Woody Guthrie  \n* [“If I Had a Hammer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVyVqnlFTdA), Pete Seeger  \n* [“We Shall Overcome”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7akuOFp-ET8), Joan Baez  \n* [“The Times They Are A-Changin’”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b3RqnzgH1E), Bob Dylan\n\n\tAudio\n\n* [“I’ve Been Working on the Railroad”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAI6wjXEV6g), John Denver  \n* [“Blowin in the Wind”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFj8uDubsE), Bob Dylan  \n* [“This Little Light of Mine”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eZ_M3EJG48), Etta James  \n* [“Gracias a la Vida” Victoria Parra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w67-hlaUSIs), Chilean folk song celebrating life and resilience  \n* [“In The Pines”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPQw79mvfeM), Loretta Lynn  \n* [“Where Did You Sleep Last Night (In The Pines)”,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tfPHBRIS14) Nirvana, a haunting American folk song with mysterious origins and lyrics that vary widely from version to version (and has been performed by many artists), often featuring themes of loss, hardship, and death.  \n* [“El Pueblo Unido Jamás Será Vencido (The People United Will Never Be Defeated)” Chilean folk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTLrFjYt8tA), A powerful anthem of resistance and unity against oppression.  \n* [“Bella Ciao” Italian Partisan Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyh_OVeQZH0), A song of resistance and defiance associated with anti-fascist movements in Italy and beyond.\n\n\tFacilitate a discussion about the characteristics of folk music with guiding questions like:\n\n* What do you notice about the music? Does it sound simple? Does it sound like you could sing it too?  \n* How do the lyrics of these songs connect to the ideas of fairness and equality?  \n* How does hearing people sing together make you feel about big ideas like justice and hope?  \n* Can you think of any examples of folk music that you have heard in your own life?",

    "title": "Echoes of History",
    "content": "Explain that the class will warm up their voices and start connecting to the tradition of music being passed down through echoing melodies.  \n\t*Echo the Melody*\n\n* Play or sing a simple melody. Instruct students to listen carefully and then echo the melody back to you with their voices, as if they are passing a song down to someone else.\n\n\t*Echo with Rhythm*\n\n* Play or sing the melody again, but this time, add a simple rhythmic clap/tap/stomp/snap/etc. to it. Instruct students to echo both the melody and the rhythm back.\n\n\t*Echo with Emotion*\n\n* Play or sing the melody one more time, but with a specific emotional tone (e.g., determined, hopeful, joyful). Instruct students to echo the melody with their voices and add a facial expression that matches and conveys the emotion.\n\n\tConclude warm up by affirming the listening and vocal skills, explaining that they will use these to sing a folk song about Global Goal 10\\."

    "content": "Choose one of the simple folk songs introduced earlier. Hand out [lyric sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SRi1va0cbRrnchHLHfrUlTRYwjn_oO-S?usp=drive_link) if desired.  \n\t*Teaching the Song:* Start by teaching the melody and lyrics line by line. Encourage students to sing together, focusing on clear pronunciation and a joyful or determined tone.  \n\t*Adding Musical Elements:* Once students are comfortable with the melody and lyrics, guide them to brainstorm how to add musical elements to enhance the song’s message.\n\n* *Rhythm and Dynamics*  \n  * Ask: How can we use a steady, strong rhythm to show determination and a sense of fairness, like we are marching for what’s right?  \n  * Then guide students to add clapping or stomping rhythm that fits this feeling.  \n  * Ask guiding questions like:  \n    * How can we use loud dynamics to show the power of our voices together?  \n    * What about soft dynamics for a quiet, hopeful part?  \n* *\\[Optional\\] Melody and Harmony*  \n  * If students are comfortable, introduce a simple harmony (e.g., a sustained note, or a second part of the melody) or a round to create a richer sound.  \n  * Ask guiding questions like:   \n    * What does it sound like when our voices sing different notes but still blend together?  \n    * How is that like a community where everyone is different but works together?  \n* *Call and Response*  \n  * Ask: How can we turn a part of this song into a call and response?  \n  * Have one group sing a line, and the rest of the class echo it back, creating a sense of unity and participation.  \n  * Ask guiding questions like:  \n    * How does it feel to echo a line?  \n    * How does it feel when everyone joins in?\n\n\tGuide the exploration, encouraging students to experiment with the music to express the feelings of the song."

    "title": "Singing Together",
    "content": "Explain that the entire class will now practice and perform the chosen folk song together. Encourage students to sing with energy and conviction, focusing on the message of the song.  \n\tLead the class in a series of performances of the song, exploring different moods and interpretations.  \n\tExamples\n\n* *The Quiet Start:* Sing softly at first, with a slow tempo.  \n  * Ask: How does that sound make you feel about the message of fairness and equality?  \n* *Building Power:* Gradually increase the volume and tempo as the class sings.  \n  * Ask: How does this make our voices feel stronger and more determined?  \n* *Harmony and Unity:* Try the harmony or call and response part.  \n  * Ask: How does that make the song sound more full and unified, like we are all one voice?\n\n\tEncourage students to explore their own interpretations of the song, adding simple hand gestures or facial expressions to enhance their performance."

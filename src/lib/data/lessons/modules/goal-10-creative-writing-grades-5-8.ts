	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.  \n\tClarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. Explain that it’s about making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.  \n\tExplain to students that journal writing (or keeping a diary) is a special kind of writing. Clarify that it’s a personal space where you can write down thoughts, feelings, and experiences, like talking to a trusted friend. Sometimes, writing in a journal can help to understand big feelings, process challenging moments, or even explore important ideas about the world, like fairness. Explain that today, they will all write fictional journal entries to explore fairness and hwo everyone deserves to feel included and respected.  \nBegin by sharing a thought-provoking quote, image, or short video clip related to inequality.  \nExamples:\n\n* “Inequality is the root of social evil.” \\- Pope Francis  \n* [Images depicting the stark contrast between wealthy and impoverished communities.](https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-45257901)  \n* [Youth standing up against racism \\- a future of race equality is within our grasp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpu_6sFk_78)  \n* [Social Norms and the Gender Wage Gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nOJf_95m4I)\n\n\tOpen the conversation with guiding questions like:\n\n* What does this image/video/quote make you think about fairness and how people are treated?  \n* What are some examples of fairness or unfairness that you have seen or experienced in your own life?  \n* Why do you think it’s important that everyone has equal chances and feels included?\n\n\tIntroduce the purpose and benefits of journal writing for this lesson:\n\n* *A Safe Space:* It’s a place to explore your true thoughts and feelings.  \n* *Understanding Ideas:* It can help to think more deeply about big ideas like fairness and how they affect people.  \n* *Telling Stories:* It’s a way to tell personal stories, even fictional ones, that can help others understand.\n\n\tShow selected examples of age-appropriate journal entries and discuss how they convey feelings and thoughts.  \n\tExamples:\n\n* *The Diary of a Young Girl,* Anne Frank  \n  * “I sometimes wonder if anyone will ever understand what I  mean, if anyone will ever overlook my ingratitude and not worry about whether or not I’m Jewish and merely see me as a teenager badly in need of some good plain fun.” December 24, 1943  \n  * “These poor people are being shipped off to filthy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick and neglected cattle.” October 9, 1942  \n  * “I long to ride a bike, dance, whistle, look at the world, feel young and know that I’m free, and yet I can’t let it show.” December 24, 1943  \n  * “We aren’t allowed to have an opinion\\! My, my, aren’t they progressive\\! Not have an opinion\\! People can tell you to shut up, but they can’t keep you from having an opinion. You can’t forbid someone to have an opinion, no matter how young they are\\!” September 27, 1942  \n* *Journal of Charlotte Forten, Free Woman of Color,* Charlotte L. Forten, September 12, 1855  \n  * “I wonder that every colored person is not a misanthrope. Surely we have everything to make us hate mankind. I have met girls in the schoolroom — they have been thoroughly kind and cordial to me, — perhaps the next day met them in the street — they feared to recognize me; these I can but regard now with scorn and contempt…These are but trifles, certainly, to the great, public wrongs which we as a people are obliged to endure. But to those who experience them, these apparent trifles are most wearing and discouraging; even to the child’s mind they reveal volumes of deceit and heartlessness, and early teach a lesson of suspicion and distrust.”  \n* *The Depression Diary of Mrs. Clara Ackerman,* Clara Ackerman, 1932  \n  * “The past year of 1931 will go into history with memories of struggles to meet taxes and loan payments, also cash rent, with prices of farm products going lower and lower toward the close of the year.”  \n  * “Hens are worth 8 cents on the market; would like to sell encough to get some dress shoes and Frank a good shirt, as he only has had one all summer, and a pair of rayon bloomers for the girls and some little thing for Dale. Then if there should be any left, would like to make another payment on Lois’ doctor bill.”\n\n\tDiscuss with guiding questions like:\n\n* What do you notice about how these journal entries show what the person/character is thinking or feeling?  \n* How do they make the person/character feel real?",

A worried voice?  \n* Can you add a detail about what your character saw or heard that made them feel sad/happy/confused/etc.?  \n* What is your character thinking about in this unfair situation?

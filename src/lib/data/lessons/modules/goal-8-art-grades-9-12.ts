    "title": "Introduction and Inspiration",
    "content": "Begin by engaging students in a discussion about their perceptions of work and economic growth. What images or ideas come to mind when they hear these terms?\n\n* When you hear the word “work,” what’s the first thing that comes to mind?  \n* What about “economic growth”? What does that look like to you?  \n* Is all work the same? What makes some jobs “better” than others?  \n* Can you think of any jobs that are invisible or undervalued?  \n* Can economic growth happen without harming people or the planet? How?  \n* Does everyone have the same opportunities for decent work? Why or why not?\n\nIntroduce the concept of “optical illusions” and how Op Art plays with our visual perceptions. Show examples of Op Art and discuss the techniques used to create these illusions.  \nOp Art Examples\n\n* Victor Vasarely, [“Vega-Nor”](https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-vasarely/vega-nor-1969)  \n* Bridget Riley, [“Movement in Squares”](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/movement-in-squares-bridget-riley/dwGpQ5o3Dc4FrQ)  \n* Yaacov Agam, [“Double Metamorphosis II”](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/3746)  \n* Marina Apollonio, [“Rilievo 703”](https://garadinervi-repertori.blog/post/762431808105332736/marina-apollonio-rilievo-703-aluminum-and?is_related_post=1)\n\n\tTechniques\n\n* *Geometric Patterns:* Tessellations, repeating shapes, optical grids to create illusions of movement and vibration.  \n* *Contrasting Colors:* High-contrast colors placed next to each other to create a sense of depth and movement.  \n* *Lines and Shapes:* Curved lines, spirals, geometric shapes to create illusions of warping, bulging, or receding.  \n* *Figure-Ground Reversal:* Playing with positive and negative space to creat ambiguous images that shift between foreground and background.  \n* *Moiré Patterns:* Overlapping layers of lines or dots to create interference patterns and a sense of vibration."

    "title": "Connecting Op Art to Global Goal 8",
    "content": "Guide students to explore how Op Art can be used to represent the complexities and sometimes “hidden” aspects of decent work and economic growth.  \n\t*Start with the “Why”*\n\n* Why might Op Art be a good way to show things about decent work and economic growth that we don’t always see?  \n  * It reveals hidden layers, plays with perception, just like these issues and aspects we don’t notice at first.\n\n\t*Unpack the “Complexities”*\n\n* What are some things about work taht are complex or have hidden sides to them?  \n  * Power dynamics, unseen labor, the impact on mental health, etc.  \n* What about economic growth? Can it have downsides too?  \n  * Inequality, environmental damage, unsustainable practices.\n\n\t*Link to Op Art’s Strengths*\n\n* How can Op Art techniques help us show these hidden sides or complexities?  \n  * Illusions of depth, things appearing/disappearing, contrasting elements to show opposing forces.\n\n\t*Provide Concrete Examples*\n\n* Imagine a pattern where the lines seem perfectly parallel, but as you look closer, they subtly diverge. What could that represent in terms of economic growth?  \n  * Growing inequality even as the economy expands.  \n* What if an image seems to have solid shapes, but they flicker and become unstable when you move? How might that connect to job security or labor rights?  \n  * Precarious work, lack of protection.\n\n\tDiscuss how Op Art can symbolize:\n\n*"

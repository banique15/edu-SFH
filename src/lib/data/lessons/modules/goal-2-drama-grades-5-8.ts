	introduction: "Welcome students to a fun drama lesson today, and let them know they will be using acting and storytelling to explore an important idea: Global Goal 2: Zero Hunger.\n\n* Explain that Global Goal 2 is a commitment to make sure everyone, everywhere, has enough healthy food to eat, all the time. It means kids can grow strong and learn well, and families have enough nutritious food every day.  \n* It’s about fairness, health, and making sure no one goes hungry.\n\nTalk to students about how actors are incredible storytellers. They can use their voices, bodies, and imaginations to show feelings, problems, and amazing solutions without even needing a big script.  \nTell students that today, they will be actors, showing what a world with and without hunger looks like, and how we can all take steps to get closer to the reality of Global Goal 2\\.",

    "title": "Warm-Up: \"The Food Web Challenge\"",
    "order": 1,
    "content": "Have students stand in a large circle. Explain that the class will be creating a “Food Web Challenge.”\n\n* Think about how everyone and everything is connected when it comes to getting food, from the sun and rain to farmers, cooks, and people who eat. Each of us is a part of this web.\n\nDistribute simple roles (or have students choose):  \nExamples:\n\n* *Nature Elements:* Sun, rain, soil, etc.  \n* *Growers:* Farmer, gardener, etc.  \n* *Processors/Transporters:* Baker, truck driver, store manager, etc.  \n* *Preparers/Servers:* Cook, parent, cafeteria worker, etc.  \n* *Eaters:* Child, teen, adult, etc.\n\nPhase 1: Healthy Food Web (Flow)\n\n* First, let’s show our healthy food web working smoothly. When I tap you on the shoulder, do a simple, silent action or sound that shows your role, and then touch the next person in the chain who depends on you.\n\n\tExample Chain:\n\n* Teacher taps “Sun” (shines brightly), → Sun taps “Rain” (gentle finger wiggles symbolzing rain drops) → Rain taps “Soil” (slow settling movement) → Soil taps “Farmer” (digging motion) → Farmer taps “Truck Driver” (steering motion) → Truck Driver taps “Grocer” (stacking motion) → Grocer taps “Cook” (stirring motion) → Cook taps “Child” (eating motion).  \n* Go around the circle a few times, letting the chain flow.\n\nPhase 2: The Challenge (Disruption)\n\n* Now, let’s see what happens if there is a small challenge\\! We will introduce a hiccup, and the person whose role is affected will show it, then everyone else in the chain will react silently.  \n* Hiccup is introduced at the beginning of the chain (announced by teacher), and that student will then change their reaction to show how they are affected.\n\n\tExample:\n\n* “The rain doesn’t come for a long time” (Student playing Rain looks sad and withers to the ground.)  \n* “The truck gets a flat tire and can’t deliver food” (Student playing Truck Driver acts frustrated, stomps foot.)  \n* “The stove breaks, so the cook can’t prepare food” (Student playing Cook looks confused, shrugs, mimes broken stove.)  \n* Have students show how the challenge affects them, and then how it affects the next person in the food web, and so on.\n\nPhase 3: The Solution (Teamwork)\n\n* Now, let’s see how our food web works together to solve it. A hiccup will again be introduced, but now when we arrive at that problem, everyone freeze. Then, the person who caused the problem, or someone else nearby, will show a solution, and the chain will flow happily again.\n\n\tExamples:\n\n* For “no rain” the “Farmer” might mime watering plants.  \n* For “flat tire” the “Grocer” might mime calling for help or fixing the tire.  \n* For “broken stove” the “Neighbor” might mime inviting the “Cook” to use their stove.\n\nLead the entire circle through this problem-and-solution chain a few times. Discuss how interconnected everyone is."

    "order": 2,
    "content": "Tell the class they are now going to create short scenes. To get these ideas, they will pick some cards that give each student a “character” and an “action/feeling” word to spark their imagination.  \nHave each student draw one “character card” and one “action/feeling card”  \nGive students 1-2 minutes to think silently: \n\n* Who is your character?  \n* What is their action or feeling?  \n* How do these two words connect to Global Goal 2: Zero Hunger?  \n* How could their body and face show this?\n\nInvite a few volunteers to briefly share their combination and a quick, silent pose or sound it inspires.  \nExamples:\n\n* *Character:* Farmer *Action:* Worried  \n  * Farmer looking at dry land, wringing hands.  \n* *Character:* Child *Action:* Celebrating  \n  * Child jumping with joy while holding an apple.  \n* *Character:* Food Bank Volunteer *Action:* Sharing  \n  * Volunteer holding out a box of food.  \n* *Character:* Parent *Action:* Searching  \n  * Parent looking through empty cupboard, a sad sigh.\n\nThis activity will generate ideas that can be build upon for the next activity."

How do they show what they’re feeling?  \n* *Body Language and Facial Expressions:* How can they use their bodies and faces to tell the story clearly without words?  \n* *Action:* What simple actions can they use to show the challenge and the solution?  \n* *Teamwork:* How does everyone in the group contribute to the scene?  \n* \\[Optional\\] *Props:* Can they use any simple classroom props?\n\nCirculate among groups, offering guidance and encouragement. Ask questions like:\n\n* What’s happening in the beginning of your scene? How does that show the challenge?  \n* How are your characters moving to show they’re trying to find a solution?  \n* What action or feeling shows the “solution” part of your scene best?  \n* How can you make the ending feel hopeful and happy?  \n* Are you thinking about how your characters interact with each other?  \n* What simple sound or gesture could add to your story without using words?"

What colors do you see? What does it smell like? (Guide them through visual and olfactory senses).  \n* *Mindful Eating:* Now, imagine slowly taking a bite. What does it taste like? What sounds do you hear as you chew? Feel the food filling your stomach. (Focus on taste and internal sensation.)  \n* *Feeling Full and Content:* Imagine feeling completely full, satisfied, and happy. Take a deep breath, feeling your stomach expand with gratitude. Let a gentle smile come to your face. Feel the warmth and peace of having enough. (Focus on positive physical and emotional sensations).  \n* *Sharing Energy:* Now, imagine sharing that feeling of fullness and contentment with everyone in our class, and then with everyone in the world.

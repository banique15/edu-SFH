My name is Charlie, and I am in high school. I don’t really know what to write, so I guess I will just tell you things as they happen.”* Charlie’s voice is conversational and relatable, capturing the awkwardness and vulnerability of adolescence.  \n  * Bridget Jones’s Diary (Fiction), a humorous and self-deprecating look at a single woman’s life in London.  \n    * *“January 1st. Ugh. New Year’s Day. Hungover. Must lose twenty pounds. Must stop smoking. Must stop drinking. Must get organized.”* Bridget’s voice is witty and relatable, capturing the internal struggles and aspirations of many women.  \n* Discuss how authors use language, tone, and point of view to create authentic and engaging journal entries.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* How can you create a believable and relatable character through their journal entries?  \n* How can you use language to convey the character’s emotions, thoughts, and experiences?\n\nDiscuss the use of vivid details and sensory descriptions to bring journal entries to life.  \n\tExamples\n\n* Analyze how authors use sensory details (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch) to create immersive and engaging journal entries.  \n* Discuss how descriptions of settings, characters, and events can contribute to the overall impact of the writing.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* How can you use descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader’s mind?  \n* How can you use details to reveal the character’s personality, values, and experiences?\n\nDiscuss how journal entries can be used to explore deeper thoughts, feelings, and reflections on personal experiences and social issues.  \n\tExamples\n\n* Share examples of journal entries that demonstrate introspection, critical thinking, and personal growth.  \n  * Marcus Aurelius (Non-Fiction), stoic philosophy and reflections on life, virtue, and self-improvement.  \n    * *“Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be.

Fear, to a great extent, is born of a story we tell ourselves, and so I chose to tell myself a different story from the one women are told. I decided I was safe. I was strong. I was brave. I was right where I belonged.”* This entry reflects Cheryl’s growing self-awareness and her determination to overcome her fears, showcasing personal growth and empowerment.  \n* Discuss how authors use journal writing to process complex emotions, challenge their own assumptions, and gain new perspectives.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* How can you use journal writing to reflect on your own experiences and beliefs?  \n* How can you use journal entries to explore different perspectives on social issues like inequality?"

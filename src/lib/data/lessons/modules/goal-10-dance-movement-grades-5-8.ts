	introduction: "Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.  \n\tClarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. Explain that it’s about making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.  \n\tBegin by showing a short video clip(s) of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performing an excerpt from an iconic piece. Explain that Alvin Ailey was an amazing choreographer who believed dance could show big feelings and tell powerful stories, especially about fairness and overcoming challenges. His dance company is famous for its powerful movements and for exploring and celebrating the rich traditions and heritages of diverse communities.  \n\tExamples  \n\t\t“[Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5pDJ4Q-Y7M)”  \n\t\t“[Streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w_77mXcNCA)”  \n\t\t“[Reflections in D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVf7fMAh12I)”  \n\t\t“[Wade in the Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5IoS5gSA74)”  \n\t\t[“Revelations”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqcHHF0c_EU)  \n\t\t[“Blues Suite”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5UH82JHoSA)  \n\t\t[“Cry”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csi1sLsEcug)  \n\t\t[“Survivors”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R15F52EWnDU)  \n\tOpen a discussion by asking guiding questions like:\n\n* How does the music make you feel when you watch them dance?  \n* What messages or stories do you think the dancers are trying to convey about feelings or life?\n\n\tFacilitate a discussion about Alvin Ailey’s life and legacy. Feel free to use a short video like [THIS ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjWJdESzx_M) if desired.\n\n* Explain that Alvin Ailey grew up at a time when racial segretation in the United states (where people were kept apart because of their skin color) was a big problem. He experienced unfairness.   \n* Clarify that he believed dance could be a way to show those feelings, celebrate culture (especially African American culture), and inspire people. He created his own dance company where people of all backgrounds could dance together.\n\n\tAsk guiding questions like:\n\n* Why do you think it was so important for Alivin Ailey to create a dance company where people of all backgrounds could dance together?  \n* How can dance, like Ailey’s be used to show feelings about unfairness, or about hope and strength?",

    "title": "Body Contract and Expand",
    "content": "Explain that the class will quickly explore two important ideas in dance, and two ideas that Ailey used to show different feelings: contraction (pulling inward), and expansion (stretching outward).  \n\tInstruct students to find a comfortable space. Play music that will inspire gentle, expressive movement.  \n\t*Contraction*\n\n* Say: Imagine you are pulling all your energy inward, like a tiny seed or a shell closing tight. Slowly curl your body into a tight, small shape. Feel your muscles gently squeeze. What feelings might this show? (e.g., feeling small, shy, worried, hidden).   \n  * Guide students to slowly contract their bodies, curling inward.\n\n\t*Expansion*\n\n* Say: Now, slowly, let your energy burst outward. Stretch your limbs wide, reach for the sky, fill up all the space around you. Feel your muscles release and lengthen. What feelings might this show? (e.g., feeling big, happy, free, confident, strong, joyful).  \n  * Guide students to slowly expand, stretching outwards.\n\n\t*Contrast and Connect*\n\n* Guide students to slowly  move back and forth between a contracted shape and an expanded shape a few times.  \n* Ask guiding questions like:   \n  * How does contracting feel different from expanding? How can these movements  \n  * How can these movements show feelings like being left out (contracted) versus being included (expanded)?\n\n\tConclude warm up by affirming these expressive abilities, explaining that Ailey used these and other similar movements to tell powerful stories."

    "title": "Exploring Ailey’s Movement Concepts",
    "content": "Explain that the class will explore a few basic modern dance movements and techniques inspired by Alivin Ailey’s style. Tell students that these techniques help choreographers dancers to show lots of different feelings and ideas.  \n\t*Contraction and Release (revisited):* Guide students to practice contracting (curling inward, exhaling) and releasing (expanding, inhaling) their torso. Emphasize the use of breath with the movement.  \n\tAsk guiding questions like:\n\n* How can a contraction show a feeling of sadness or struggle?  \n* How can a releaase show hope or freedom?\n\n\t*Grounded Movement:* Explain that Ailey’s dancers often felt very connected to the floor. Guide students to explore moving with a strong, grounded feeling, like their feet have roots (e.g., heavy steps, deliberate turns, low balances).  \n\tAsk guiding questions like:\n\n* How does being grounded make you feel strong or determined, like you are standing up for something important?  \n* What does it feel like to stand tall and strong, as if you can’t be pushed over? How is this physical feeling like having a strong sense of fairness?\n\n\t*Expressive Gestures and Reaching:* Explain that Ailey’s dances used a lot of clear hand and arm movements to show emotions and stories. Guide students to:\n\n* Practice reaching movements: reaching out for something, reaching up for a goal, or reaching to connect with someone.  \n* Explore simple hand gestures that show feelings like worry (hands clasped), strength (fist), or hope (open palm).\n\n\tAsk guiding questions like:\n\n* What does a reaching movement show when you’re trying to achieve something or connect with someone?  \n* How can you use your hands and arms to show the difference between a closed feeling (like being left out) and an open feeling (like being welcomed)?  \n* What gesture can you create with your hands to show that you are giving help to someone, or receiving help?\n\n\tContinue to play expressive music during these explorations, encouraging students to connect the movements to feelings."

    "title": "Feeling/Concept Movement Cards",
    "content": "Explain that the class will brainstorm ideas for their upcoming dance pieces by drawing cards about fairness or challenges. They will then connect and show them with Ailey-inspired dance movements.  \n\tDivide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with one set of Feeling/Concept Movement Cards.  \n\t[Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hMg4MbLBdCyOJ2BtLowM0roMRUKH14TFBsnTTyBWAko/edit?usp=sharing)  \n\tInstruct groups to spread out all their cards. Explain they will sort their cards into two piles:\n\n* *Fairness and Inclusion:* Cards that represent positive feelings or concepts of equality.  \n* *Challenges and Unfairness:* Cards that represent difficulties or unequal situations.\n\n\tAfter sorting, instruct each group to choose just one card from either pile that they find particularly interesting or important. This card’s idea will be the main theme for their short dance piece.  \n\tThen instruct groups to brainstorm 2-3 specific movements, shapes, or transitions from their Ailey-inspired exploration (contraction/release, groundedness, reaching) that could express their chosen card’s idea.  \n\tExamples:\n\n* *Card is “Left Out”*: Contracted, small shape, moving away from others with a sad face.  \n* *Card is “Strong”*: A grounded, wide stance with strong, reaching arms, looking determined.  \n* *Card is “Working Together”:* People reaching towards each other, synchronized forward step, connecting hands.\n\n\tCirculate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:\n\n* How can you show “feeling left out” using a contraction?  \n* What kind of grounded movement shows “respect”?  \n* How would a reaching movement show “hope”?"

    "title": "Creating Our Equality Dances",
    "content": "Explain that each group will now create a short dance piece (about 1-2 minutes long) based on the chosen Feeling/Concept Movement Card and the brainstormed movements. The dance should use Ailey-inspired movements to tell a story or show feelings about Global Goal 10\\.  \n\tInstruct groups to:\n\n* *Use Their Card:* Clearly show the feeling or concept from the chosen card.  \n* *Use Ailey Movements:* Incorporate contraction/release, grounded movements, and expressive gestures/reaching.  \n* *Show a Story/Feeling:* The dance should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, showing how the feeling/concept develops (e.g., from small to strong, from apart to together).  \n* *\\[Optional\\] Choose Music:* If audio/music players are available for each group, select music that complements the choreography and effectively conveys the message of the chosen theme. (Otherwise, all groups can choreograph to the same music, played class-wide).  \n* *Practice:* Rehearse the dance piece.\n\n\tCirculate, offering guidance and encouraging creative choices. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* How are you showing inclusion with your groups shapes?  \n* Can you use a contraction to show a moment of struggle, then expand for hope?  \n* Are you all listening to the music and moving together?"

    "title": "Sharing and Discussion",
    "content": "Have each group share their dance pieces with the class. Encourage the audience to observe carefully and reflect on the messages and emotions conveyed through the movement.  \n\tFacilitate a class discussion about the dance pieces, focusing on the connection to Global Goal 10, the effectiveness of the choreography, and the overall impact of the performances. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* What feelings or ideas about fairness and equality did you see in these dances?  \n* Which movements or gestures (e.g., a strong reach, a unified shape, a gentle contraction) stood out to you? What did they make you think about?  \n* How did using Ailey’s style (like contracting, or strong grounded movements) help show the larger message?  \n* How did the dances make you think differently about Global Goal 10?  \n* What messages about fairness or inclusion do you think the dances would send to others?\n\n\tInvite students to share:\n\n* What ideas did you want to show?  \n* How did you use Ailey’s movements to show these?"

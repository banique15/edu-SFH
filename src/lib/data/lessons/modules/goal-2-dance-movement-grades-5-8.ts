	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting movement exploration, and explain that today they will be using to power of their videos to explore the important idea of Global Goal 2: Zero Hunger.\n\n* Discuss how Global Goal 2 is a commitment to make sure everyone, everywhere, has enough healthy food to eat, all the time. It means kids can grow strong and learn well, and families have enough nutritious food every day.  \n* It’s about fairness, health, and making sure no one goes hungry.\n\nTell students that dance and movement are amazing ways to express feelings, tell stories, and understand big ideas without having to use words. We can use movement and dance to show challenges, feelings of hope, and how we can all work together to make things better.  \nBegin with a gentle warm-up to get the class ready to move.  \nFocus on stretching and loosening up. As the class stretches, guide them to think about movement that helps them feel ready, strong, and prepared.  \nExamples of warm-up movements with guiding prompts:\n\n* [*Spine Rolls*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQ9SPwNPvY)*:* Let’s imagine our spine is like a long, flexible noodle. Slowly roll down from your head, letting your arms dangle, allt he way to your knees, and then slowly roll back up. Feel each part of your back stretch. (Encourage slow, mindful movement.)  \n* [*Shoulder Shrugs and Rolls*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7NtgY9kCCM)*:* Shrug your shoulders up to your ears like you’re trying to hide your neck. Now let them drop. Roll them forward in big circles, then backward. What does it feel like to release tension in your shoulders? (Focus on tension and release.)  \n* [*Ankle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XX3R9ibBfw) *and [Wrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRSk1_C6yOM) Circles:* Gently lift one foot and make circles with your ankles. Now change direction. Do the same with your wrists. Imagine loosening up all the small joints in your body, preparing them for big movements. (Small, controlled movements.)  \n* *Full Body Shake:* Let’s shake out our bodies\\! Start with your fingers, then your hands, your arms, your feet, your legs, and finally your whole body. Shake, shake, shake\\! How does it feel to shake it all out? (Energetic, loose movement?)  \n* *“Wake Up” Stretch:* Reach your arms out wide like you’re hugging the biggest tree, then reach them up to the sky like you’re trying to touch the clouds. Stretch as far as you can. Take a deep breath in, and let it out as you slowly lower your arms. (Expansive, full-body stretches.)",

    "title": "Moving for a Full Plate",
    "order": 1,
    "content": "Explain that the class will be using a “Word and Movement Spark” to brainstorm ideas for dancing.   \nCall out words connected to Global Goal 2, and have students think about how those words make their bodies want to move, or what sounds those words make them think of.  \nWrite the words in different places on the whiteboard or large paper. After saying each word, give students a few moments to think about the corresponding movement/sound, then invite quick, non-verbal demonstrations or verbal suggestions of movement ideas and note them under the main word.  \nExamples:\n\n* *Hunger:* What movement or sound comes to mind when you hear “hunger”?  \n  * Examples: A tummy rumble sound, a slow tired slump, an empty reaching hand, a quiet sigh, a heavy step.  \n* *Sharing:* How would your body show “sharing”?  \n  * Examples: Open hands, reaching out, a gentle giving motion, two people coming together, a wide smile.  \n* *Growth:* What movement reminds you of “growth”?  \n  * Examples: Starting small and slowly getting taller, stretching upwards, unfurling like a leaf, a gentle sway.)  \n* *Strength:* How would you show “strength” with your body?  \n  * Examples: Standing tall, strong arms, a determined face, firm feet, powerful punching motion, flexing muscles.)  \n* *Harvest:* What movement or sound comes to mind for “harvest”?  \n  * Examples: A bending and picking motion, gathering things, a full basket, sounds of rustling crops, a happy sigh of completion.  \n* *Empty:* How does your body show “empty”?  \n  * Examples: Hollow chest, open, floppy hands, slumped shoulders, quietness, looking around for something missing.  \n* *Full:* What movement shows “full”?  \n  * Examples: Big round belly, satisfied sigh, expansive arms, stretching out, bouncing with energy, a joyful jump.  \n* *Helping Hands:* How would your body show “helping hands”?  \n  * Examples: Hand reaching out, hands joining together, a gentle lift, a supportive touch, a warm hug motion.\n\nThis brainstorm will directly generate movement vocabulary for students to use in the next activity."

    "title": "Movement Exploration: The Journey of Food",
    "order": 2,
    "content": "Explain that the class is going to go on a “Journey of Food” with our bodies, using the movements and feelings that were just explored. This journey will show what happens when food is scarce, how people work to get it, and the joy of having enough.\n\n* *Phase 1/The Challenge/The Seed’s Struggle* (Play the “Challenges” music): Guide students through the movements that reflect scarcity, hunger, or difficulty in getting food.  \n  Examples:  \n  * Imagine you are a tiny seed, trying to grow in very dry, hard ground. How do you push? How do you struggle to stretch upwards?  \n    * Curling up small, slow, restricted movements, gentle pushing against invisible resistance.  \n  * You are a person searching for food. Your steps are heavy and slow. You look around, but the cupboards are empty. How do you show that feeling of searching, maybe a bit tired or worried?  \n    * Slow, dragging steps, looking left and right with worried eyes, gently rubbing stomach, slumped shoulders.  \n  * What if you were trying to find clean water for your plant or yourself, and it was far away or difficult to reach? How would your body show effort and thirst?  \n    * Stretching, reaching, panting sounds, tired learning, mimicking carrying a heavy bucket.  \n* *Phase 2/Action or Growth/Growing and Helping* (Transition to the “Hope and Action” Music)*:* Guide students through movements that show effort, growth, and people helping each other.  \n  Examples:  \n  * A gentle rain falls. You are that dry seed again, and you feel the water. How do you start to push up, little by little, stretching toward the light?  \n    * Slowly unfolding, reaching upwards, stretching, feeling lighter.  \n  * You are a farmer, caring for the new plants. How do you gently dig, plant, water, and then watch the crops grow tall and strong? Show how you work together with others.  \n    * Mimicking planting, watering, raking; movmeents that show care and cooperation, reaching out to others.  \n  * You are part of a community sharing food. How do you pass a delicious, imaginary fruit to a friend? How do you accept it? How does your body show thankfulness and joy?  \n    * Open hands, gentle giving and receiving motions, smiling, nodding, light steps, small jumps of joy.  \n* *Phase 3/Hope or Solution/The Big Harvest and Celebration* (Continue with “Hope and Action” music, increasing the energy: Guide movements that celebrate abundance and community.  \n  Examples:  \n  * It’s harvest time\\! The fields are full\\! How do you move to gather all the wonderful, healthy food? Show us the joy and energy of a big harvest\\!  \n    * Energetic gathering motions, lifting imaginary baskets, happy spins, wide, open gestures.  \n  * Now, everyone is sitting down together for a big, shared meal. How do you move to show fullness, happiness, and connection with everyone around you? What sounds of laughter or contentment do you make?  \n    * Happily rubbing stomach, satisfied sighs, big smiles, reaching for food, gentle swaying with happiness, arms wrapped around oneself or others.\n\nEncourage students to use their whole bodies, including facial expressions, to convey their feelings."

Feel the stretch in the back of your neck. Slowly roll your head to one side, then to the other, like a gentle wave moving from side to side.  \n* *Shoulder/Arm Wave:* Now, let a wave move down your shoulders, slowly wiggling them. Let it flow down your arms, wiggling your elbows, then your wrists, and finally your fingers. Shake out your fingers gently like a wave rippling.  \n* *Torso Wave:* Let a gentle wave move through your back. Slowly arch your back slightly, then round it, like a gentle ocean wave. Feel your spine curving and stretching.  \n* *Leg/Foot Wave:* Let the wave move down your legs. Gently wiggle your knees, then your ankles. Finally, wiggle your toes and feel the wave move right out of your body into the floor.  \n* *Full Body Wave:* Now, let’s put it all together. Imagine a gentle, slow wave starting at your head and slowly flowing all the way down to your toes, releasing any last bits of tension. (Guide through a final, slow, full body relaxation motion).\n\nEnd with a few deep breaths, emphasizing feeling calm and ready for the next activity."

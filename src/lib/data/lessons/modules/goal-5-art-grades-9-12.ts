	introduction: "Begin by showing images or videos of polluted water sources and contrasting them with pristine natural environments. Examples:\n\n* Pristine Natural Environments  \n  * [Banff National Park, Canada](https://www.britannica.com/place/Banff-National-Park)  \n  * [Crater Lake National Park, Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZADEu0QvmQ)  \n  * [Water of the Maldives](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/c7gnpz/does_anyone_else_find_crystal_clear_water_super/#lightbox)  \n  * [Great Barrier Reef, Australia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Barrier-Reef)  \n  * [Amazon Rainforest](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/where-does-amazon-river-begin/)  \n* Polluted Water Sources  \n  * [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/)  \n  * [Bangladesh’s “dead river”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=t85EDm75i1Q)  \n  * [Citarum River, Indonesia](http://www.austroindonesianartsprogram.org/blog/most-polluted-river-world-citarum-river-indonesia)  \n  * [Ganges River, India](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/israel-and-india-team-up-to-restore-the-ganges-river/)  \n  * [Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Gulf of Mexico](https://www.britannica.com/event/Deepwater-Horizon-oil-spill)\n\nOpen a discussion with questions like:\n\n* How do these images make you feel?  \n* What role does water play in our lives and in the health of our planet?  \n* Beyond the immediate feeling, what long-term impact do you think these polluted scenes have? On people? On the environment?  \n* Contrastingly, what opportunities or benefits do you see in the pristine images and videos? How might access to clean water change lives?  \n* Do you think art can be a tool to make people care about environmental issues? Why or why not?  \n* Can you think of any examples where art has been used to raise awareness about pollution or water scarcity?\n\n\tBriefly re-introduce Global Goal 6 if needed: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.”  \n\tExplain how color field painting, with its emphasis on large areas of flat color and emotional impact, can be a powerful way to represent the vastness and importance of water, as well as the challenges and solutions related to its preservation.  \n\tShare images of color field paintings and artists. Examples:\n\n* [No. 61 (Rust and Blue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._61_\\(Rust_and_Blue\\)), Mark Rothko: This painting features contrasting colors that evoke a sense of depth and mystery, inviting viewers to explore their own interpretations.  \n* [Mountains and Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_and_Sea), Helen Frakenthaler: This groundbreaking work, created using her signature \"soak-stain\" technique, features flowing colors that evoke a sense of fluidity and movement, reminiscent of water.  \n* [Riverhead](https://www.frankenthalerfoundation.org/artworks/riverhead/details/all), Helen Frankenthaler: The flowing, watery forms and colors in \"Riverhead\" can symbolize the essential nature of water, its dynamic movement, and the interconnectedness of water systems.  \n* [PH-950](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/clyfford-still-ph-950), Clyfford Still: The contrasting colors and textures in this abstract piece can be interpreted as representing the stark difference between polluted and clean environments. The jagged edges and dark hues may evoke feelings of unease or alarm, highlighting the negative impacts of pollution on our water sources and the urgency of addressing this issue.  \n* [Light Depth](https://www.si.edu/object/light-depth%3Ahmsg_2018.036), Sam Gilliam: This large-scale, draped canvas installation, with its vibrant colors and flowing forms, can evoke a sense of the vastness and power of water. It can also represent the importance of access to clean water for all, as well as the need for sustainable water management practices to preserve this precious resource.\n\n\tDiscuss how colors and their interplay can evoke emotions and convey ideas without relying on representational forms.",

    "content": "Divide the class into small groups or allow them to work individually.   \n\tAssign each a different Global Goal 6 Target, providing them with the simplified explanations to ensure understanding.  \n\tEach group/student brainstorms colors that represent the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with their assigned target.  \n\tEncourage students to think beyond literal representations and consider the symbolic and emotional power of colors.  \n\tUse guided questions during brainstorming to help students find their way. Examples:\n\n* What colors represent the emotions associated with the goal/target? (e.g., hope, fear, anger, joy, etc.)  \n* What colors symbolize the challenges and solutions related to this goal/target? (e.g., polluted water vs. clean water, scarcity vs. abundance, etc.)  \n* Are there any cultural or symbolic associations with specific colors that are relevant to this goal/target?  \n* How can we use color combinations and contrasts to create a powerful visual message?\n\n\tExample color palettes for Global Goal 6 targets\n\n* *Target 6.1 \\- Clean Water Access*  \n  * Thirst: dusty browns and yellows  \n  * Hope: sky blue, turquoise  \n  * Empowerment: bright yellow, orange  \n* *Target 6.2 \\- Sanitation and Hygiene*  \n  * Disease: sickly greens, browns  \n  * Dignity: clean white, soft blues  \n  * Community Action: intertwining colors to represent collaboration  \n* *Target 6.3 \\- Clean Water*  \n  * Determination: clear blue, lush green, bright yellow  \n  * Pollution: sickly greens, purples, dark grays and blacks  \n  * Frustration: harsh reds and oranges, muddy browns  \n* *Target 6.4 \\- Water Use Efficiency*  \n  * Scarcity: deep red, warning orange  \n  * Conservation: earthy greens, calming blue  \n  * Innovation: silver, bright yellow  \n* *Target 6.5 \\- Integrated Water Management*  \n  * Cooperation: harmonious blends of colors, interconnected shapes  \n  * Conflict: clashing colors, sharp lines  \n  * Balance: calming greens and blues, symmetrical patterns  \n* *Target 6.6 \\- Protecting Ecosystems*  \n  * Biodiversity: lush greens, vibrant colors representing diverse life  \n  * Degradation: muted gray, browns  \n  * Restoration: lively greens, clear blues, yellows  \n* *Target 6.a \\- International Cooperation*  \n  * Shared Responsibility: intertwined colors from different flags/cultures  \n  * Aid and Support: warm yellows and oranges, healing greens  \n  * Progress: bright and optimistic colors, upward movement  \n* *Target 6.b \\- Community Participation*  \n  * Empowerment: bold, strong colors, active figures  \n  * Collaboration: interconnected shapes and patterns, diverse color palette  \n  * Voice and Representation: bright colors to demand attention, bold imagery"

Use guided questions such as:\n\n* Were there any surprises in how your classmates interpreted your work?  \n* Did hearing the artist's explanation change how you saw the piece?  \n* Which artworks resonated with you the most, and why?  \n* Did the art help you see the Global Goal 6 targets in a new light?  \n* How did the use of color and abstraction convey the complexity of these issues?  \n* Do you think art can be a more impactful way to communicate about these topics than just facts and figures? Why/why not?  \n* Did any artwork make you reflect on your own water usage or habits?  \n* How can we, as individuals, contribute to solutions for clean water and sanitation?  \n* Do you feel more connected to this global goal now, having explored it through art?"

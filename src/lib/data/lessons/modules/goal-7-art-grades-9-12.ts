	introduction: "Begin by showing videos of impactful environmental issues related to energy production and consumption.  \nExamples:\n\n* [Ending Energy Poverty](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2014/10/14/ending-energy-poverty), World Bank Group  \n* [Energy Poverty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xraThzKoXU8), Bill Gates\n\n\tRe-introduce Global Goal 7, if necessary: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.  \n\tOpen a discussion connecting to students’ lives, by asking questions like:\n\n* Can you imagine your life without reliable access to electricity or clean cooking fuels?  \n* What kind of impact do you think these problems have on people’s health, the environment, and our future?  \n* Think about a typical day in your life. How do you use energy from the moment you wake up to the time you go to bed?  \n* What are some energy sources that power your home, school, and community?  \n* Have you ever experienced a power outage? How did it affect your daily routine?  \n* Have you noticed any changes in the environment around you that you think might be related to energy production or use?  \n* Do you know anyone who struggles to afford their energy bills or doesn’t have access to reliable energy sources?\n\nBriefly explain the concept of installation art, highlighting its immersive and transformative nature. Show examples of installation art that addresses energy themes.\n\n* [Waste Labyrinth](https://publicdelivery.org/luzinterruptus-waste-labyrinth/), Luzinterruptus  \n* [Seven Magic Mountains](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/artists/this-magic-moment-ugo-rondinone-places-seven-mountains-in-the-desert-outside-las-vegas-6438/), Ugo Rondinone  \n* [The Weather Project](https://olafureliasson.net/artwork/the-weather-project-2003/), Olafur Eliasson  \n* [Siemens Boabab Tree](https://mymodernmet.com/daniel-popper-siemens-boabab/), Daniel Popper  \n* Imagine walking into an art exhibit, but instead of just looking at paintings on a wall, you’re surrounded by the art itself. You can walk through it, touch it, maybe even interact with it. That’s what installation art is all about \\- creating an immersive experience that makes you think and feel differently about the world around you. It’s like stepping into another reality, one that the artist has created to convey a message or evoke emotions.",

    "title": "Goal and Target Exploration and Brainstorming",
    "content": "Divide the class into groups, assigning each group a goal or target. Provide each group with a simplified explanation.  \n\tEncourage groups to begin brainstorming ideas for an installation art piece that represents their goal/target. Consider the following prompts:\n\n* What objects, materials, or symbols can represent the challenges and solutions related to the goal/target?  \n* How can you engage sight, sound, touch, or even smell to create an immersive experience for the viewer?  \n* Can you incorporate interactive elements that allow viewers to engage with the artwork and reflect on its message?  \n* Consider how the installation will interact with the chosen space in the classroom or school.\n\n\tExamples of installation art ideas connected to targets\n\n* *Target 7.1 \\- Access to Energy*  \n  * Create a silhouette scene on a wall using cardboard cutouts. One side depicts a village in darkness, the other side shows the same village illuminated after gaining access to electricity. Use a lamp or flashlight on phone to cast light, demonstrating the transformative power of energy access.  \n  * String yarn or twine across a corner of the room, creating a web-like structure. Attach paper cutouts of houses, schools, and hospitals to the web, symbolizing how energy connects and empowers communities.  \n* *Target 7.2 \\- Renewable Energy*  \n  * Make simple pinwheels from colorful paper and attach them to recycled bottles or tubes. Arrange them in a cluster, creating a “wind farm” that spins with even a gentle breeze.  \n  * Cut out various shapes from reflective and other materials to make a “solar garden” showcasing the power of the sun.  \n* *Target 7.3 \\- Energy Efficiency*  \n  * Collect common household items or cut out paper to represent these items. Create a display showing the “before” (inefficient) and “after” (energy-efficient) versions of these items. Add labels explaining the energy savings associated with each upgrade.  \n  * A series of everyday objects (either real/recycled or created as art) transformed to be more energy efficient (again, can either be real or transformed in an imaginary/sci fi sort of way), highlighting the potential for innovation.  \n* *Target 7.a \\- International Cooperation*  \n  * Each student in the group decorates a “quilt square” with symbols or images representing their culture and ideas about clean energy. Connect the squares to create a collaborative quilt symbolizing global cooperation.  \n  * Cut out paper lanterns or light bulb shapes and have students decorate them with messages of hope and collaboration related to clean energy. String lanterns together to create a chain that stretches across the room.  \n* *Target 7.b \\- Infrastructure and Technology*  \n  * Collect pieces of old electronics or cut out/create representations and create a sculpture representing the evolution of technology. Highlight how innovation can lead to more sustainable energy solutions.  \n  * Use recycled cardboard and other materials to create a miniature model of an ideal city powered by renewable energy sources. Include things like wind turbines, solar panels, green spaces, and efficient transportation systems."

    "title": "Creation and Construction",
    "content": "Have groups gather their chosen materials and begin constructing their installation art pieces.  \n\t\tEncourage students to adapt and modify their installation art pieces based on available resources and their own creativity.  \n\tCirculate around the classroom, encouraging teamwork, problem solving, and creative expression throughout the process. Ask questions such as:\n\n* Tell me a bit about the concept behind your installation. What message are you trying to convey?  \n* How are you using these specific materials to represent your assigned target?  \n* What challenges have you encountered so far, and how are you overcoming them?  \n* How is your group collaborating and sharing ideas during the construction process?  \n* What are some unexpected or surprising elements you’ve incorporated into your artwork?"

  {
    "title": "Presentation and Reflection",
    "content": "Lead the class on a gallery walk, pausing at each installation for a few minutes of silent observation and interaction.  \n\tEncourage students to\n\n* *Observe:* Take in the visual elements, textures, and overall impact of the installation.  \n* *Interact:* If the piece allows for it, carefully touch or engage with the interactive elements.  \n* *Reflect:* Consider the message the artists are trying to convey and how it connects to the Global Goal/target.\n\n\tAfter the silent observation, invite the group responsible for the installation to step forward and share their creative process and intentions.   \n\tEncourage the presenting group to:\n\n* Explain the concept behind their installation and the materials they used.  \n* Connect their artwork to the specific target and the broader theme of affordable and clean energy.  \n* Share any personal experiences or inspirations that influenced their work.\n\n\tIf time allows, open the floor for questions and comments from the class, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the artwork.  \n\tAfter the gallery walk has been completed, gather the class together for a discussion, asking questions such as:\n\n* What common themes or messages emerged across the different installations?  \n* Were there any surprising or unexpected interpretations of the targets?  \n* Which installations resonated with you the most, and why?  \n* How did working collaboratively on these installations shape your understanding of energy challenges and solutions?  \n* What were some of the challenges or successes you experienced during the creative process?  \n* How did the use of recycled or repurposed materials influence your thinking about sustainability?  \n* In what ways can art be a powerful tool for raising awareness about environmental issues and inspiring action?  \n* How did these installations make you feel about the importance of affordable and clean energy?  \n* What are some other creative ways we can use art to communicate about Global Goal 7 and other sustainability issues?"

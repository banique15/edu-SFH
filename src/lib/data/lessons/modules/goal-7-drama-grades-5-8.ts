	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting drama and theater class. Explain that they will use acting and imagination to explore a really important topic: Global Goal 7, Affordable and Clean Energy.  \nThis goal focuses on making sure everyone, everywhere, has access to energy that is affordable (not too expensive), reliable (always there when you need it), and clean (good for the planet). You emphasize that this means lights for homes and schools, clean ways to cook food, and power for our devices, all without harming the Earth.",

    "title": "Warm Up: Energy All Around Us",
    "content": "Ask students to close or rest their eyes for a moment.  \nAsk: Think about your morning today. What’s one thing you used that needed electricity or energy?  \nHave students quickly share responses. Examples:\n\n* Alarm clock/phone  \n* Toaster  \n* Tablet  \n* Lights  \n* Television  \n* Car\n\nAffirm their answers: Wow, look at all the ways energy powers our lives before we even get to school. It’s everywhere.   \nAsk: Imagine if one day, your alarm didn’t go off because there was no power, you couldn’t toast your bread, or your tablet wouldn’t charge. How would that make you feel? What would be different?  \nListen to responses, drawing out feelings of frustration, inconvenience, or even sadness.  \nGently guide students: For many people around the world, this is actually their everyday life. They don’t have reliable electricity. Or the energy they use makes the air dirty. That’s why Global Goal 7 is so important \\- to make sure everyone has access to the right kind of energy."

    "title": "Introduction to Forum",
    "content": "theater  \nExplain: Today, we’re going to become problem solving actors using a special kind of theater called Forum theater. It’s like a play, but the audience gets to jump in and change the story.  \nThe Rules:\n\n* *The Scene:* A small group will show us a short play about a challenge or problem related to energy. It won’t be a perfect play, just a quick idea.  \n* *STOP:* While they’re acting, if you see a moment where a character could make a different choice, or if you have an idea that might help solve the problem, you can shout “STOP\\!”  \n* *What Else Could Happen”* When someone shouts “STOP\\!” the actors freeze. Then, the person who stopped the scene can tell us: what else could the character do or say? What new idea could we try here?  \n* *Jump In:* If you have a really strong idea and want to show us, you can even step into the scene to try out your idea. You become a “spect-actor”, part spectator, part actor.  \n* *Replay:* The actors (with any new spect-actors) will then replay that part of the scene with the new idea. We’ll see if it helps\\! We can stop and try new ideas as many tiems as we need to find solutions.\n\nEmphasize that Forum Theater is about:\n\n* *Teamwork:* Everyone helps solve problems.  \n* *Exploring Ideas:* No bad ideas, just trying out different ways.  \n* *Finding Solutions:* We use our creativity to make things better.  \n* *Power of Choice:* We see how small choices can make a big difference."

    "title": "Brainstorm: Energy Character Challenge",
    "content": "Divide the class into groups of 4-6 students. Provide each group with one pre-written Energy Scene Starter Slip.  \n[Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EvEuYFkRnLjpVeQVsQaWyZ0Ml-a0j-OxaK3WZQdhNQ/edit?usp=drive_link)  \nInstruct each group to look at their scene starter, the characters, and the problem. Challenge them to quickly discuss and prepare a very short scene (1-2 minutes long) about this problem. Have them focus on showing the characters’ feelings and the challenge clearly.  \nClarify that no script needs to be written, they can improvise based on the scene starter or have planned dialogue, whatever works best for their group.  \nExample discussion points for groups:\n\n* Who will play each character listed?  \n* What are the most important lines or actions to show the problem?  \n* How will you show the characters’ feelings (frustration, tiredness, worry, confusion)?  \n* What simple props (optional) could be used to make the scene clearer?  \n* What are some possible ways you might try to solve this problem if you were the audience intervening? (This preps for audience interventions).\n\nGive groups 5-7 minutes to quickly discuss the scene starter, assign roles, and decide on a few lines or actions to show their problem.   \nCirculate, offering guidance and encouragement, prompting them to think about hw they will clearly show the problem for the audience."

    "title": "Forum Theater Performance",
    "content": "Bring the class back together. Explain that each group will perform their short scene, and the audience will be ready to “STOP\\!” and offer solutions.  \nInvite the first group to perform (volunteer or you choose). Remind the audience of the “STOP\\!” and “What Else Could Happen?” rules.  \nThe group performs their short scene, depicting the challenge or conflict related to energy.  \nExample Scenario Played Out:\n\n* *Student 1:* “Oh no, not again\\! Our project is due tomorrow, and I can’t even see my notes\\!”  \n* *Student 2:* “Why is it always dark when we need to work? This is impossible\\!”  \n* *Student 3:* “Forget it, I can’t do this in the dark. I’m giving up.”  \n* *Teacher:* “I can’t find a flashlight anywhere. This power outage is making things very difficult.”  \n* *AUDIENCE MEMBER YELLS “STOP\\!”*  \n  * Freeze the actors. Say: Great stop\\! What else could the characters do or say here to help with the dark? or What new idea could we try in this scene to get light?  \n    Example Audience Suggestions:  \n    * Maybe the teacher could suggest using phone flashlights?  \n    * See if anyone has a solar lamp?  \n  * Ask the original actors: Would you like to try that? Or would someone from the audience like to jump in and show us?\n\n*REPLAY* \n\n* *Teacher (either original or spect-actor):* “Wait\\! I have my phone? And hey \\[Student 1\\], didn’t you mention your family has a solar powered lamp? Maybe you could bring it tomorrow\\!.”  \n* *Student 1:* “Yes\\! I forgot\\! We could totally use that\\!”\n\nYou might ask for another “STOP\\!” to explore different solutions, or prompt the students yourself if they need a little help.  \nRepeat this process for the rest of the groups, depending on time and engagement. For each scenario, encourage at least one STOP and replay with a new idea.  \nKey points to facilitate during intervention:\n\n* Guide students to suggest actions or dialogue that change the scene.  \n* Remind them to focus on positive changes that align with Global Goal 7\\.  \n* After each replay ask questions like: Did that help? Why or why not? What was different?  \n* Connect suggested solutions back to Global Goal 7 concepts (e.g., That’s a great example of using clean, reliable energy. or That shows how important affordable energy is for learning.)."

    "content": "Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  \nAsk guiding questions like:\n\n* How did acting out scenes and trying to change them in Forum Theater help you understand Global Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in a new way?  \n* What did you learn about how our choices, even small ones, can affect energy problems or solutions?  \n* Which scene or spect-actor intervention made you think the most, and why?  \n* What do these activities tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 7?  \n* What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to save energy or promote clean energy, perhaps because you now feel more confident in finding solutions?"

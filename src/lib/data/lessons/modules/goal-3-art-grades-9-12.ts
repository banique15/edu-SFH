    "title": "Narrative Writing: A Day in the Life",
    "content": "Instruct students to write a short sotry or vignette in the third-person limited point of view, focusing on a single day in their character’s life.  \n\tExplain to students how to write in third-person narrative if needed:\n\n* *“He/She/They” Focus:* Tell the story using pronouns like “he,” “she,” or “they” to refer to your character.  \n* *One Perspective:* The story is told from the viewpoint of **one** character. You’ll see the world through **their** eyes, know **their** thoughts and feelings, but not anyone else’s directly.  \n* *Limited Knowledge:* You only know what **your** character knows. If they’re surprised by something, the reader is too. No peeking into other people’s heads\\!  \n* *Example:* “Sarah nervously clutched her vaccination card. “Will this protect me?” she wondered, glancing at the crowded clinic. “It has to.”\n\n\tEncourage students to:\n\n* Vividly describe their character’s surroundings, thoughts, and feelings.  \n* Show the challenges they face due to the health issue.  \n* Hint at their hpes, dreams, or resilience in overcoming these challenges.  \n* Consider including interactions with other characters that highlight the social and community impact of the health issue.\n\n\tExample Prompts:\n\n* *Target 3.1:* “Amina woke up before sunrise, the contractions already starting. She knew the journey to the nearest clinic would be long and arduous…”  \n* *Target 3.2:* “Aisha rocked her feverish baby, her heart heavy with worry. The nearest clinic was miles away, and the dirt roads were treacherous. “Please, just hold on a little longer,” she whispered, tears streaming down her face.”  \n* *Target 3.3:* “Kojo coughed, his chest tight. Each breath was a struggle. He knew he needed to see the doctor, but the long walk to the clinic seemed impossible…”  \n* *Target 3.4:* “David sat on the edge of his bed, the weight of the world pressing down on him. He knew he needed help, but the stigma surrounding mental health kept him silent…”  \n* *Target 3.5:* “Emily hid the empty bottle under her bed, shame washing over her. “Just one more day,” she told herself, “then I’ll quit.”  \n* *Target 3.7:* “Elena’s heart pounded as she entered the family planning clinic. “I need to take control of my future,” she thought, “but will they understand?”  \n* *Target 3.8:* “Maria clutched her daughter’s hand tightly as they waited in the crowded clinic. The cost of medicine was exorbitant, but she would do anything to save her child’s life…”  \n* *Target 3.9:* “Every morning, Xiao woke to a thick smog that stung his eyes and made it hard to breathe. “How much longer can we live like this?” he thought, anger rising in his chest.”  \n* *Target 3.a:* \"Dr. Singh sighed, looking at the stack of tobacco-related illness reports on his desk. 'Another day, another battle,' he thought. 'But we will not give up. We will make our country healthier.'\"  \n* *Target 3.b:* \"Dr. Patel peered into the microscope, her eyes focused on the tiny, deadly pathogen. 'We are so close,' she muttered, her fingers tracing the intricate molecular structure. 'This vaccine could save countless lives.'\"  \n* *Target 3.c:* \"Nurse Fatima's shift had long ended, but the waiting room was still full. Exhaustion gnawed at her, but she pushed through, knowing each patient deserved her full attention. 'One more, then I rest,' she promised herself, her smile unwavering.\"  \n* *Target 3.d:* \"The alert flashed across Dr. Kim's screen \\- a new cluster of cases in a remote village. 'We have to move fast,' she said, her voice firm. 'Every second counts in containing an outbreak.'\""

	introduction: "Begin with a dynamic warm-up to prepare student’ bodies for movement and get them energized. Include a variety of stretches, cardio exercises, and movement explorations.  \nLead a movement-based icebreaker to foster a sense of connection and collaboration within the class.  \n\t*Example:* Have students move around the room and greet each other with a unique movement or gesture.  \nIntroduce the concept of mirroring in  movement and dance.  \n\tKey Points\n\n* Mirroring involves two or more people moving in sync with each other, reflecting each other’s movements like a mirror.  \n* It requires focus, observation, and nonverbal communication.  \n* It can be used to build trust, empathy, and connection.  \n* It can be applied creatively to express ideas and emotions.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* What are some examples of mirroring in everyday life? (e.g., conversations, social interactions)  \n* How can mirroring be used to communicate without words?  \n* What are some of the benefits of mirroring in dance and movement?\n\nIntroduce/re-introduce Global Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. Explain the core idea of building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation.  \nBriefly introduce the different targets within Global Goal 9, highlighting their interconnectedness and importance.  \n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* What are some of the challenges in achieving these targets?  \n* How might these targets affect different people and communities around the world?",

    "content": "*Basic Mirroring*\n\n* Pair students up and have them practice basic mirroring exercises.  \n* One student is the leader, and the other is the follower.  \n* The leader initiates movements, and the follower mirrors them as closely as possible.\n\nEncourage students to focus on clarity, precision, and nonverbal communication.\n\n* Ensure both students have a chance to play both roles.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* What are some of the challenges of mirroring?  \n* How can you improve your mirroring skills?  \n* How does it feel to be the leader versus the follower?\n\n*Mirroring with Variations*  \n\tIntroduce variations to the mirroring exercises, such as:\n\n* Changing roles mid-mirror (without stopping the movement) (leder and follower switch).  \n* Adding levels (high, medium, low).  \n* Incorporating different qualities of movement (smooth, sharp, fluid, bound).  \n* Adding emotional expression to the movement.\n\n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* How do these variations affect the mirroring experience?  \n* How can you use mirroring to express different ideas or emotions?\n\nDiscuss how mirroring can be used to create a sense of connection and empathy between partners.  \nEncourage students to pay attention to their partner’s movements and energy, and to respond in a way that shows understanding and support.  \n\tGuiding Questions\n\n* How does mirroring help you understand your partner better?  \n* How can you use mirroring to build trust and support?"

  "How did the practice of mirroring \\- reflecting another person’s movements \\- help you understand the concept of collaboration and interconnectedness that is central to Global Goal 9?",
  "What did you learn about non-verbal communication and empathy through mirroring? How might these skills be important in building global partnerships for innovation and infrastructure?",
  "How did physically embodying different aspects of Global Goal 9 (e.g., resilient infrastructure, innovation, technology transfer) change your understanding of those concepts?",
  "Did the act of moving in sync with a partner create a sense of unity or shared purpose? How does this relate to the idea of countries or organizations working together?",

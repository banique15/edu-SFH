    "content": "Begin with a gentle warm-up to prepare students’ bodies for movement.  \nPlay upbeat and rhythmic music to energize students and get them moving during the warm-up. This can include a variety of music selections, including spirituals, gospel, blues, and jazz, reflecting the diverse influences in Ailey’s choreography.  \n\tExamples  \n\t\t[Wade in the Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPCXRNFzUI)  \n\t\t[Sinner Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adi_RESrcyQ&list=PLJa-XdbM-QRCVfy4TSovIxykw9uLAbZMY&index=11)  \n\t\t[Revelations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPCXRNFzUI&list=PLJa-XdbM-QRCVfy4TSovIxykw9uLAbZMY) (by Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater)  \nInclude stretches, basic exercises, and simple movement sequences.  \nIntroduce basic modern dance techniques inspired by Ailey’s style.  \n*Contraction and Release:* Explore the concept of contracting and releasing the torso, a key element in Ailey’s choreography.  \n*Fall and Recovery:* Practice falling and recovering from the floor, emphasizing fluidity and control.  \n*Flexibility and Extension:* Encourage students to explore their flexibility and range of motion through stretches and extensions.  \n*Grounded Movement:* Emphasize the importance of connecting with the floor and using gravity to create powerful and expressive movements.  \nIntroduce a basic movement vocabulary inspired by Ailey’s choreography.  \n\tExamples\n\n* Strong, grounded movements representing resilience and determination (connection to Target 10.1 \\- income growth).  \n* Contracting movements representing oppression or struggle (connection to Target 10.2 \\- social inclusion).  \n* Reaching movements symbolizing hope and aspiration (connection to Target 10.3 \\- equal opportunity).  \n* Have students share their own movement vocabulary and how it connects to different targets in Global Goal 10\\.\n\nCombine the basic techniques and movement vocabulary to create short movement phrases. Demonstrate the phrases and have students practice them, encouraging them to explore their own interpretations and expressions."

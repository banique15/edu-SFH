	introduction: "Welcome students to an exciting music lesson \\- we’re going to use the power of music and rhythm to explore the important idea of Global Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being.\n\n* This goal aims to make sure everyone, everwhere, has a healthy life and feels good, no matter their age. Today, we’re going to focus on a super important part of staying healthy: everyone getting the care they need.  \n* This means that when you’re sick or hurt, you can get help from doctors and nurses, and get the medicine you need, no matter where you live or how much money your family might have.  \n* It’s about making sure health care is fair and available for everyone.\n\nTalk to students about how music can make us feel strong, determined, or even help us understand big challenges. Today, we’ll use sound, music, and rhythms to create musical stories that show what it’s like to need help and how we can find musical ways to show solutions for a healthier world where everyone gets care\\!",

    "content": "Introduce the Sound and Movement Mirror to the class.\n\n* Make a sound and a simple movement. The students will then copy or “mirror” that sound and movement exactly.  \n* Then, the next person will create their own sound and movement for the class to mirror. (Or, can continue to mirror multiple sound and movement from the educator)."

    "title": "Care Access Chord Chart Brainstorm",
    "content": "Explain the activity:\n\n* We’re going to create a Care Access Chord Chart on the board/paper. We’ll think about musical sounds and rhythms for different parts of a story about getting healthcare \\- from needing help to getting well.\n\nDraw three large, connected bubbles or boxes on the whiteboard/paper, like a flow chart:\n\n* *Needing Care/Challenge Sounds:*  \n  * What sounds or rhythms would you use to show someone needing medical help but maybe not getting it easily? What does that feel like musically? Write these ideas in the correct section using one color marker (e.g., red).  \n    Examples:  \n    * Slow, dragging rhythm  \n    * Quiet, worried whispers  \n    * A single, long held note that feels sad  \n    * A quiet cough sound (vocals)  \n    * A fast, shaky beat  \n    * A “no” sound (vocals)  \n    * A feeling of slowness or quietness in the music  \n    * A heavy thud  \n    * A worried sigh  \n    * A searching sound with shakers  \n* *Journey to Care/Action Sounds:*  \n  * What sounds or rhythms show someone trying to get help, or people working to bring help? What’s the journey sound? Write these ideas in the correct section using a neutral color marker (e.g., black).  \n    Examples:  \n    * A steady, walking beat (like someone traveling)  \n    * A determined drum rhythm  \n    * Sounds of searching (shakers)  \n    * A calling sound  \n    * Sounds of a vehicle  \n    * A knocking sound  \n    * A getting ready or preparing sound (using various instruments)  \n* *Recieving Care/Solution Sounds:*  \n  * What sounds or rhythms happen when someone gets the help they need and starts to feel better? What does geting care and feeling well sound like? Write these ideas in the correct section using a positive color marker (e.g., blue).  \n    Examples:  \n    * A steady, strong heartbeat (drum)  \n    * Gentle, calm hums  \n    * Cheerful laughter  \n    * Light, bouncy rhythms  \n    * A clear, high “ding” (like a bell)  \n    * Sounds of playing  \n    * A happy “yes\\!” sound  \n    * Bright energetic music  \n    * Joyful harmonies"

    "title": "Songs of Care and Connection",
    "content": "Explain that music can tell powerful stories, and that the class is going to listen to a couple of songs that talk about helping others, being strong, or finding connections.   \nHave students notice how the music makes them feel, and how the words, sounds, and rhythm tell a story.  \nPlay one to two age appropriate songs with themes of kindness, community, or overcoming challenges. Focus on simple positive messages.  \nExamples:\n\n* [“Count on Me” by Bruno Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k8cpUkKK4c) (friendship, support)  \n* [“You’ve Got a Friend in Me” by Randy Newman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hG-2tQtdlE) (friendship, care)  \n* [“Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBCVM4KbUM) (hope, positivity)  \n* [“Lean on Me” by Bill Withers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOZ-MySzAac) (support, community)\n\nAfter the song(s), facilitate a brief discussion. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* What was the main message of this song about helping or caring?  \n* How did the music make you feel?  \n* Did any words or sounds in the song remind you of our Chord Chart?"

    "title": "Our Health Anthem Verse",
    "content": "Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a few simple percussion instruments (or different instruments if available and appropriate for skill set), or remind them they can use body percussion/improvised instruments.  \nExplain that each group will create a short musical verse (about 30-45 seconds long) that tells a story about Global Goal 3, using sounds and rhythms from our Care Access Chord Chart.  \nThe verse will show:\n\n* *A Challenge:* Start with sounds from Needing Care.  \n* *The Journey:* Show sounds from Journey to Care.  \n* *The Solution:* End with sounds from Receiving Care.\n\nDistribute Health Challenge Cards to each group (one card per group). This gives a specific challenge to start their story. They then create their own “journey” and “solution.”  \nEncourage groups to think about:\n\n* *Their story:* How will they show the challenge on the card, the journey and the solution?  \n* *Instruments/sound:* Which sounds from the brainstorm best fit each part of their story?  \n* *Musical Elements:* How cna they use changes in dynamics (loud/soft), tempo (fast/slow), and rhythm (steady/uneven), to show the progression from challenge to solution?  \n* *Collaboration:* How will everyone in the group contribute to all parts of the musical story?\n\nCirculate among groups, offering guidance and encouraging creativity. Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* How can you use \\[instrument\\] to make the sound of \\[insert sound here\\]?  \n* Can you make your rhythm sound more \\[worried/determined/joyful/etc.\\]?  \n* How can your group’s sounds blend together to create a feeling of help and healing?  \n* What’s one special sound your group can make with your voices or bodies that fits your stories solution?"

Ask guiding questions like:\n\n* What challenges did you hear in the first part of their music?  \n* What journey did you hear in the middle?  \n* What solution or positive change did you hear in the last portion?  \n* What emotions did their music make you feel?"

  "Originality and effort in crafting musical pieces. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 3.8 (does the music clearly relate to the challenge of getting care, the journey, and the solution?), and use of elements (are there attempts to use musical elements like rhythm, dynamics, sound choices, and simple vocalizations, to convey the chosen story?).",

				title: "Small, Everyday Actions to Inspire Change",
				items: [
					"Reduce Plastic Consumption: Consciously minimize your use of single-use plastics (bags, bottles, straws, packaging). Opt for reusable alternatives. Every piece of plastic kept out of the environment is a victory for the ocean.",
					"Dispose of Waste Properly: Ensure all waste, especially hazardous materials, is disposed of correctly and never put down drains or flushed down toilets. This prevents land-based pollution from reaching waterways and the ocean.",
					"Be a Responsible Seafood Consumer: If you eat seafood, research sustainable fishing practices and choose seafood that is certified as sustainably sourced. Avoid purchasing species that are overfished or caught using destructive methods.",
					"Conserve Water: Reduce your water usage at home. Less water used means less wastewater eventually making its way back to marine environments.",
					"Reduce Chemical Runoff: Be mindful of the chemicals you use in your home and garden. Choose eco-friendly cleaning products and avoid over-fertilizing lawns to prevent nutrient pollution.",
					"Support Ocean-Friendly Businesses: Prioritize businesses that demonstrate a commitment to ocean conservation, sustainable practices, and ethical sourcing of marine products.",
					"Educate Yourself and Others: Learn about the impacts of ocean acidification, marine debris, and overfishing. Share this knowledge with friends and family.",
					"Participate in Beach/Waterway Cleanups: Even if you don't live near a coast, participating in local river, lake, or park cleanups helps prevent litter from reaching the ocean."

					"Prepare and deliver informative presentations or workshops, incorporating the creative elements from the lessons, to educate your peers and community about Global Goal 14 and inspire ocean conservation.",
					"Use your artistic voice to satirize or highlight the absurdity of unsustainable fishing practices, excessive plastic use, or disregard for marine ecosystems.",
					"Research local, national, or international policies related to marine protected areas, fisheries management, or pollution control. Write letters to government officials, or participate in campaigns advocating for stronger ocean protection laws."

					"In your community, advocate for solutions that reduce land-based pollution reaching waterways, such as improved stormwater management, wastewater treatment, or green infrastructure projects.",
					"Work with your school or local community to create public art installations using recycled materials, especially ocean plastic, to visually represent the impact of pollution and inspire action.",

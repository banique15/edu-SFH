							"**Launch a School Supply Swap:** Inspired by the idea of ensuring everyone has enough to learn with (Target 4.1), organize a School Supply Swap, event at school or in your neighborhood/community. Students can bring in gently used school supplies they no longer need and swap them for items they do, or donate extra supplies to a local charity.\n\n**Concrete Action:** Plan and execute a School Supply Swap event once a year to redistribute usable school materials."

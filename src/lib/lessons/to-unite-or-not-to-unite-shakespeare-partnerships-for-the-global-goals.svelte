	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with an introduction to Shakespeare.\n<ul>\n<li>William Shakespeare was a renowned English playwright and poet whose works from the late 16th and early 17th centuries are still studied and performed today. His plays often explore universal themes of power, justice, cooperation, and the complexities of human relationships.</li>\n<li>We’ll look at short excerpts that touch upon these themes, focusing on the language and dramatic situations rather than the complex plot details.</li>\n</ul><br>Briefly introduce key elements of Shakespearean language.\n<ul>\n<li>When we read Shakespeare, the language can sometimes seem a little different from how we speak today, but don’t let that intimidate you. Think of it like listening to a slightly older version of English, like how someone from a different generation might use some words differently than you do. The core of the stories and emotions are still very much the same.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Here are a couple things you might notice:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Iambic Pentameter (The rhythm):</em> Shakespeare often wrote his plays in a rhythm called iambic pentameter. It might sound a bit technical, but it just means that many of the lines have a kind of heartbeat rhythm to them. Imagine saying “ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM.” There are ten syllables in the line, alternating between a softer and a stronger beat. This rhythm gives the language a kind of musicality and flow. Don’t worry about counting every beat perfectly; just listen for that natural, almost song-like quality in some of the lines. It’s part of what makes Shakespeare sound so powerful and memorable.</li>\n<li><em>Thee and Thou (Old pronouns):</em> You’ll also see some different pronouns used. Instead of “you,” Shakespear often used “thee” and “thou.” Think of it simply as another way of saying “you.” Sometimes, “thou” was used when speaking to someone familiar or of lower status, and “thee” was often used as the object of a verb (like “I see thee”). It’s not essential to know all the grammatical rules right now; just understand when you see “thee” or “thou,” it generally means “you.”</li>\n<li><em>Other Words or Phrases:</em> You might encounter some words that aren’t common today, or phrases that sound a little old-fashioned. Don’t get bogged down trying to understand every single word perfectly. Often, you can get the general idea from the context of the sentence and the emotions the characters are expressing.</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 17: strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Emphasize the need for collaboration across nations and sectors.<br>Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 17: strengthening domestic resources, official development assistance, mobilizing financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, trade, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.<br>Connect Global Goal 17 and Shakespeare.\n<ul>\n<li>While Shakespeare didn’t write about the UN or sustainable development as we know it today, his plays often depict the dynamics of power, trade, alliances, and the responsibilities of leaders, which resonate with the principles of global partnership.</li>\n<li>We’ll explore how the relationships and dialogues in these excerpts can illuminate the importance of cooperation, shared resources, and mutual support - the very essence of global Goal 17.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

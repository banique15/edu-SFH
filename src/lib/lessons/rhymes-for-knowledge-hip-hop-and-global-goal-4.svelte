	<Introduction content={"<p>Start with a simple beat, either teacher-led or using a pre-recorded loop. Have students clap along, then encourage them to add their own variations (snaps, foot stomps, vocal sounds, beatboxing, etc.)<br>Once comfortable with the rhythm, begin a freestyle circle. Go around the circle, each student adding one word that rhymes with the previous one. This builds quick thinking and word association skills.<br>Open a discussion. Example questions:<br><em> How does rhythm play a role in learning? (memory aids, focus, etc.)<br></em> Why is freestyle/improvisation valuable? (thinking on your feet, confidence, etc.)\n<ul>\n<li>Connect to Goal 4; how can these skills help us in education and in life?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Lyric Analysis: Education Anthems"} content={"<p>Choose 1-2 hip hop/rap songs with themes relevant to education. Examples:<br><em> Nas, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvVfgvHucRY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I Can</a><br></em> Slick Rick, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea-ezolZq5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hey Young World</a><br><em> 3 Titans ft.

Example Questions:<br></em> What’s the main message of each song about education?<br><em> Do any lyrics resonate with your own experience?<br></em> How do these artists use their platform to address Global Goal 4 themes?</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Rhyme and Reason: Writing for Change"} content={"<p>Students can work alone or in small groups, each assigned a different Global Goal 4 Target.<br>Have students write a short rap verse (4-8 lines) addressing their Target.<br>Writing prompts<br><em> </em>Challenges:<em> What are the barriers to achieving this Target?

(policy changes, community action, individual effort, etc.)<br><em> </em>Empowerment:* How can education be a tool for change and personal growth?<br>If time and resources allow, have students create a simple beat to go with their verse, or find an instrumental beat online that fits the mood.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Mic Drop: Performance and Feedback"} content={"<p>Each group/student performs or reads their verse (however they feel most comfortable).<br>Encourage them to add their own flair, even if they’re not comfortable rapping fully.<br>Open a discussion. Example questions:<br><em> </em>Constructive Feedback:<em> Rather than focusing solely on the performance aspects (flow, rhythm, etc.), guide feedback towards the core message of the verse.<br></em> Was the Target’s main challenge and at least one solution clearly expressed? Or did the verse end without any clarity of a potential solution? Could listeners understand this issue without prior knowledge?<br><em> Did the verse evoke any emotions or thoughts about the issue? Was it memorable or thought-provoking?<br></em> Were the solutions presented realistic or at least inspiring possibilities? Did they show understanding of the complexity of the problem?<br><em> Did the verse offer a unique perspective or creative approach to the topic? Did it stand out from other verses?<br>Connect the dots by synthesizing the individual verses into a cohesive understanding of Global Goal 4\\. Example Questions:<br></em> <em>Overlapping Themes:</em><br><em> Did you notice any themes or ideas that came up in multiple verses?<br></em> How do these different perspectives show the interconnectedness of the various targets within Global Goal 4?<br><em> </em>Contrasting Experiences<em><br></em> Did any verses highlight contrasting experiences or challenges faced by different groups in accessing quality education?<br><em> How do these differences emphasize the importance of equity and inclusion in education?<br></em> <em>Collective Vision</em><br><em> Based on what we’ve heard today, what does a world with quality education for all look like?<br></em> How can you, as students, contribute to making this vision a reality?</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"The Biodiversity Puzzle Brainstorm"} content={"<p>Tell students that, as a class, they will create a biodiversity puzzle that is both a shared art piece and a brainstorming activity. This can be created on a large piece of paper placed on the floor, or on a table.<br><em>The Healthy Ecosystem</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt students to imagine a healthy forest or grassland. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What would you see there?</li>\n<li>What would you find on the ground?</li>\n<li>Ask students to bring their collected natural items/choose from the classroom collection, and place them on the paper or table to create a vibrant, diverse ecosystem. Encourage students to use different types of leaves for plants, small twigs for trees, or pebbles for a riverbed.</li>\n<li>As they add items, ask what each item represents to them and to the larger art piece.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Missing Piece</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt students to imagine that one type of plant or animal is in danger and disappears from the ecosystem the class just created. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What would that look like in our art?</li>\n<li>How would this affect our ecosystem?</li>\n<li>Ask a few students to deliberately remove items from the art piece, creating an empty space.</li>\n<li>Ask students how the art piece looks now. Does it look full and healthy, or like there is a missing piece?</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Restoration</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt students to show how we can help heal the ecosystem, asking guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What can we do to help restore a missing piece of the puzzle?</li>\n<li>What kinds of things can people do to help nature heal?</li>\n<li>Invite a new group of students to add items back or add new ones to fill in the empty spaces. Ask each student to talk about their “action” when they add an item.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li>“I’m putting this flower here to show how we can plant new things.”</li>\n<li>“I’m adding this group of leaves to show how we can help a group of animals have a home again.”</li>\n</ul><br>This activity turns the abstract concept of biodiversity into a visual, hands-on puzzle that students can create and fix.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Individual Story Art"} content={"<p>Now, tell students that they will each create their own art pieces, choosing one powerful idea from the collaborative puzzle to create their own story. Ensure all students have cardboard or sturdy paper and glue. If desired, students can also use crayons, markers, colored pencils, etc. to assist in the creation of their natural art.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Choosing a story:</em> Encourage students to choose a story to tell with their art. It could be about a specific endangered animal, a beautiful forest that needs to be protected, or a piece about how we can help nature grow.</li>\n<li><em>Using our materials:</em> Students will use the natural items collected/available in class to tell their story. Remind them that they don’t have to glue everything down right away; they can arrange the items first until they find a story they like.</li>\n</ul><br>Walk around the room and offer guidance. Help students to think about how to use different shapes, colors, and textures to tell their story (e.g., sharp twigs to represent a threat, soft leaves to represent safety).</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Small Group Gallery Walk and Storytelling"} content={"<p>When the art is finished, have students break into small groups of 3-4. Each group will have its own mini “gallery walk” where they share their art and discuss it. This provides a safe, comfortable space for every student to share their work and voice. Have students discuss the works within their small groups, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What is the main story of this art piece?</li>\n<li>What natural materials were used, and why were they chosen?</li>\n<li>How does this art connect to Global Goal 15 and the idea of protecting biodiversity?</li>\n</ul><br>After all students have shared in the small groups, you can invite a few volunteers from the groups to share their favorite part of the activity with the whole class.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did working directly with materials from nature feel different from using only crayons or paint?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the different textures and shapes you can find in the natural world?</li>\n<li>After creating your art and seeing the work of your classmates, what is one small thing you can do to help protect a part of nature near you?</li>\n<li>How does our art show that we all have a role to play in protecting life on land?</li>\n<li>The art we created today is a story.

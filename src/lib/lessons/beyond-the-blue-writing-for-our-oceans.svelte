	<CustomSection title={"Beyond the Blue: Writing for our Oceans"} content={"<strong>(30-60 MINUTES)</strong>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Materials:"} content={"<p>Paper or notebooks<br>Pens/pencils<br>Whiteboard or large chart paper<br>Markers<br>A selection of small objects that represent the ocean, its inhabitants, and its challenges (e.g., a small fish toy, a shell, a small piece of rope, a colorful rock, a twisted up piece of plastic, etc.)</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by introducing Global Goal 14. Discuss its importance, emphasizing that the ocean is not only a home for countless creatures but also a vital part of our planet’s health, giving us food, oxygen, and even helping to regulate the climate.<br>`\t`Explain the concept of “Show, Don’t Tell” as a creative writing superpower. Tell students that “telling” is like a photograph without any feeling; it gives you the facts but doesn’t let you experience them. “Showing” is like a movie in your mind; it uses details to let you see, hear, feel, and even taste and smell the story. It makes a reader feel like they are right there in the moment.<br>To demonstrate, give a simple example that is easy to understand, like:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Telling:</em> The dog was happy.</li>\n<li><em>Showing:</em> The dog’s tail wagged so fast its whole body wiggled. A big, sloppy grin stretched across its face, and it let out a happy little yip.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Then, connect the concept to Global Goal 14 with another example, like:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Telling:</em> The ocean was polluted.</li>\n<li><em>Showing:</em> A translucent plastic bag floated past like the ghost of a jellyfish. Below the surface, a bright orange fish swam frantically, its tail tangled in a discarded plastic ring.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Emphasize that a writer’s job is to make the reader feel something, and “showing” is a great way to do that.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"The Writer’s Toolbox"} content={"<p>`\t`Let students know that they will brainstorm, as a class, by building a writer’s toolbox together.<br>`\t`Place a small box/basket/bowl/etc. at the front of the room. One at a time, reveal the objects in the container. Each object will represent a different aspect of the ocean and/or its challenges. Have students shout of words that describe the object, and write these words on the whiteboard/large paper.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>A Shell or Smooth Stone</em></li>\n<li><em>Representation:</em> A beautiful, healthy ocean</li>\n<li><em>Prompts:</em></li>\n<li>What does this shell feel like? Is it smooth, cool, or a little rough?</li>\n<li>What kinds of sounds would you hear on a beach where you find a shell like this? What would the water look like?</li>\n<li><em>Words to write on the board:</em> Smooth, cool, salty, peaceful, calm, sparkling, clear, gentle, waves.</li>\n<li><em>A Small Fish or Sea Creature Toy</em></li>\n<li><em>Representation:</em> The amazing life in the ocean</li>\n<li><em>Prompts:</em></li>\n<li>What does a real fish in the ocean do? How does itg move through the water?</li>\n<li>What would it feel like to touch it?</li>\n<li>What sounds would a busy, healthy coral reef make?</li>\n<li><em>Words to write on the board:</em> Darting, shimmering, vibrant, slick, a chorus of clicks and bubbles, a dance of light and color.</li>\n<li><em>Twisted Piece of Plastic/Crushed Can</em></li>\n<li><em>Representation:</em> Marine pollution</li>\n<li><em>Prompts:</em></li>\n<li>This represents something that should not be in the ocean. What does it look like?</li>\n<li>What does it feel like?</li>\n<li>What would you hear on a beach filled with trash?</li>\n<li>What would the water look like?</li>\n<li><em>Words to write on the board:</em> Sharp, rusty, tangled, dull, dirty, a crunching sound underfoot, a plastic graveyard, slimy, a chemical smell.</li>\n<li><em>A Piece of Rope/Small Fishing Net</em></li>\n<li><em>Representation:</em> Overfishing</li>\n<li><em>Prompts:</em></li>\n<li>Imagine this is a fishing net. What would it feel like if you were a fish caught inside it?</li>\n<li>What sounds would a big fishing boat make?</li>\n<li>What would a fisherman’s boat look like if there were no more fish left to catch?</li>\n<li><em>Words to write on the board:</em> Tangled, heavy, desperate, empty, silent docks, a boat with no fish, the smell of old rope.</li>\n<li><em>A Small, Shiny, Colorful Rock</em></li>\n<li><em>Representation:</em> Call to action and a brighter future</li>\n<li><em>Prompts:</em></li>\n<li>This rock is like a treasure, it reminds us of the beautiful things we are trying to protect. What would a clean ocean look like?</li>\n<li>What would it feel like to stand on a clean beach?</li>\n<li>What would you hear?</li>\n<li><em>Words to write on the board:</em> Clean, shimmering, hopeful, bright, sunlight on the water, waves lapping the shore, happy voices, a feeling of pride.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`After the activity, the whiteboard/paper will be covered in a rich vocabulary of sensory words and phrases. These are the tools students will use to “show, don’t tell.”</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Guided Writing: Bringing the Ocean to Life"} content={"<p>`\t`Now, students will use the writer’s toolbox to rewrite simple “telling” sentences. The goal is for them to choose one sentence and expand it, using the words that were just brainstormed.<br>`\t`Provide students with sentences to choose from. Each sentence is a “telling” statement related to Global Goal 14.<br>`\t`Examples<br>`\t`Give students time to choose one sentence and then, using the words and ideas brainstormed, rewrite it. Encourage them to add details for all five senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, and even a feeling that’s like taste, like the salt on the air).<br>`\t`Example Rewrite:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Original:</em> The ocean was full of garbage.</li>\n<li><em>Rewrite:</em> A plastic bottle, its label faded and peeling, bobbed in the waves. A ghostly plastic bag swirled just below the surface, its handles like thin, tangled ropes. The water, a murky gray instead of sparkling blue, smelled like old oil and decay. The only sound was the hollow crunch of plastic trash washing up on the shore.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Walk around the room and offer support and guidance. Encourage students to use strong verbs and focus on painting a clear picture for the reader.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Sharing Our Stories"} content={"<p>`\t`Once students have had time to work on their writing, invite them to share their rewritten sentences with the class. This is a chance for them to hear the power of “showing” firsthand. As they read their sentences, you can ask the class to close or rest their eyes and picture the scene the writer is describing.<br>After a few sentences are read, ask the class questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What did you see in your mind?</li>\n<li>What emotions did that make you feel?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Continue to share until all sentences are read, time allows, or all volunteers have shared.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did focusing on sensory details change how you wrote about the ocean? How did it make the topic feel more real?</li>\n<li>We used words to make people feel something. Why is it important to make people feel something about an issue like ocean health, instead of just telling them the facts?</li>\n<li>How did seeing all the different ways we can describe the problem or the solution in our writing make you think about your own ability to make a difference?</li>\n<li>What is one thing you can do to help protect the ocean?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the Writer’s Toolbox brainstorm, independent writing, sharing, and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Comprehension of Global Goal 14 and the concept of “show, don’t tell.” This will be evidenced by the descriptive nature of the writing and contributions to the discussions.</li>\n<li>Ability to transform a “telling” statement into a vivid “showing” description. Look for the effective use of strong verbs, specific details, and sensory language.</li>\n<li>How clearly and powerfully the rewritten sentences communicate the intended message. Did they successfully evoke a feeling in the listener? Did they paint a clear picture?</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate creative choices and provide thoughtful feedback on classmates’ sentences.</li>\n<li>Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life below water.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

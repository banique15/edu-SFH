	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by introducing the limerick as a kind of poetry. Explain that it’s a five-line poem with a very specific rhyming pattern: AABBA.<br>The first, second, and fifth lines rhyme with each other, and the third and fourth lines rhym with each other. (All “A’s” rhyme, and all “B’s” rhyme.)<br>A great way to explain the rhythm is to clap or tap it out. The first, second, and fifth lines are a bit longer and have a bouncy feel, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and quicker.<br>Break down the rhyme scheme even more, and visually on the board/large paper, if helpful and needed:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Line 1:</em> Rhymes with lines 2 and 5. (A)</li>\n<li><em>Line 2:</em> Rhymes with lines 1 and 5. (A)</li>\n<li><em>Line 3:</em> Rhymes with line 4. (B)</li>\n<li><em>Line 4:</em> Rhymes with line 3. (B)</li>\n<li><em>Line 5:</em> Rhymes with lines 1 and 2. (A)</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce Global Goal 16. Explain that this goal is about building a world where everyone is treated fairly. It’s about being kind, working together to solve problems, and making sure that our communities and leaders are fair and just.<br>Explain to students that this lesson will focus on how we can use the clever and funny nature of limericks to make a serious point about these important topics.<br>Write a sample limerick on the board/large paper and label the rhyme scheme.<br>Example:<br>There once was a mayor so bold, (A)<br>Whose stories were truly quite told. (A)<br>When he’d make a new law (B)<br>It would break every flaw (B)<br>And the people would watch all the gold. (A)<br>If desired, share some additional “traditional” limericks for context. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Oh Teenage Metabolism, Where Art Thou</em> by John Watt</li>\n</ul><br>When I was a teen, I would munch <em>(A rhyme)</em><br>My way through the whole Sunday brunch. <em>(A rhyme)</em><br>I’d destroy the buffet, <em>(B rhyme)</em><br>Then as we walked away, <em>(B rhyme)</em><br>I would ask my poor mother, “When’s lunch?” <em>(A rhyme)</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Skateboarder</em> by Drjim Martin</li>\n</ul><br>A skateboard he tried to ride.<br>He didn’t there long abide.<br>It went airborne,<br>It did not forewarn,<br>He landed on his under side!\n<ul>\n<li><em>Job Interview</em> by Nitesh Aggarwal</li>\n</ul><br>There once was a boy, named Abdul;<br>Went to get a job, fresh out of school<br>All dressed up like July,<br>With a bow and a tie;<br>But left his fly open, what a fool!<br>NOTE: Many “traditional” limericks may be inappropriate for students. Straddle the line of communicating the fun and comedy of limericks without being inappropriate for the class.<br>Start a discussion about this example limerick. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some of the things you notice about this limerick?</li>\n<li>Does the humor make the topic of a leader and the law easier to talk about?</li>\n<li>Can a short poem like this be used to make people think about big ideas?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"The Fairness Frame"} content={"<p>This brainstorming activity will get students to think about how they can use humor and creativity to talk about justice and peace.<br><em>The Situation</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to think about a funny, simple situation that could happen in their community or in a story. Have them think about a time when something wasn’t fair, or when people didn’t get along, but make it silly.</li>\n</ul><br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>Have you ever had to share somethingthat you really didn't want to?</li>\n<li>What happens when everyone wants to be the leader of a group project?</li>\n<li>Imagine a world where the only rule is that everyone must wear their shoes on the wrong feet.</li>\n<li>What if a magical rule-maker appeared, but all their rules were completely backwards and silly?</li>\n<li>Think of a time when you and a friend disagreed on the rules of a game. How did that feel?</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Challenge</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to think about a problem or challenge that could be related to this situation.</li>\n</ul><br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>In our funny situation, what goes wrong?</li>\n<li>What is the problem that will need to be fixed?</li>\n<li>What is the most unfair part of the situation, and how does it make the characters feel?</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Twist</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to think about a funny or clever solution to the problem.</li>\n</ul><br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How could this problem be solved in a surprising, funny, or even weird way?</li>\n<li>What if a magical object or a weird rule appeared to make things fair again?</li>\n<li>How could the characters use something that's totally useless in a weird, new way to solve their issue?</li>\n</ul><br>This activity will help students connect the serious concepts of fairness and justice with a lighthearted, imaginative approach, while using the basic structure of a limerick.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

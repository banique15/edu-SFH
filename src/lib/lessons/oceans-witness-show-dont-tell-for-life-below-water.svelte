	<CustomSection title={"“Show, Don’t Tell” Activity: Ocean Scenes"} content={"<p>Guide the class through a structured writing activity to practice “show, don’t tell” related to Global Goal 14.<br>Step 1: Initial “Telling” Sentences\n<ul>\n<li>Provide a list of simple “teling” sentences related to different aspects of Global Goal 14.</li>\n<li>Students write down these sentences in their notebook/on their paper, or hand out a sheet with the sentences. Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>Global Goal 14</strong> <em>(Overall)</em></li>\n<li>There were no more fish.</li>\n<li>The coral reef was dying.</li>\n<li>We need to save the ocean.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.1</strong> <em>(Marine Pollution)</em></li>\n<li>The ocean was polluted.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.2</strong> <em>(Marine Ecosystem)</em></li>\n<li>The coral reef was damaged.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.3</strong> <em>(Ocean Acidification)</em></li>\n<li>The water was becoming acidic.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.4</strong> <em>(Sustainable Fishing)</em></li>\n<li>There were no more fish.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.5</strong> <em>(Marine Protected Areas)</em></li>\n<li>The marine park was beautiful.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.6</strong> <em>(Fisheries Subsidies)</em></li>\n<li>The fishermen were angry.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.7</strong> <em>(Economic Benefits to Small Island Developing States)</em></li>\n<li>The islanders depended on the sea.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.a</strong> <em>(Marine Technology)</em></li>\n<li>Scientists were studying the ocean.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.b</strong> (Access for Small-Scale Artisanal Fishers)</li>\n<li>The small boats couldn’t fish.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Target 14.c</strong> (Implementation of International Law)</em></li>\n<li>Countries were arguing about the ocean.</li>\n</ul><br>Step 2: Brainstorming Sensory Details:\n<ul>\n<li>For each “telling” sentence, the class brainstorms specific sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) and actions that could be used to “show” the scene.</li>\n<li>Write these on the whiteboard/large paper.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li><strong>Global Goal 14</strong> <em>(Overall)</em></li>\n</ul><br><em>There were no more fish.</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Empty fishing boats returning to the harbor; a barren seabed; small, young fish struggling to survive.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The silence of the fishing docks; The cry of a hungry seabird.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t\t`<em>The coral reef was dying.</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> The vibrant tapestry of the reef once full of color and movement; faded to a ghostly white; the coral branches brittle and lifeless crumbled at a touch.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The eerie silence where the dance of reef fish had been.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t\t`<em>We need to save the ocean.</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> The storm surge crashed against the shore; the waves clawed at the land.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The roar of the waves were a plea; a song of urgency played with every crashing wave.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.1</strong> <em>(Marine Pollution) The ocean was full of plastic.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Plastic bags drifted like ghostly jellyfish; a rainbow sheen on the water’s surface; a turtle struggling to swim through a plastic ring.</li>\n<li><em>Smell:</em> The acrid smell of decaying plastic; a chemical odor in the air.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The crunch of plastic underfoot on the beach, the faint rattle of plastic colliding in the waves.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.2</strong> <em>(Marine Ecosystem) The coral reef was damaged.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Bleached white skeletons of coral; algae-covered rocks; a lone fish darting between broken branches.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The eerie silence where once there was a chorus of reef life; the gentle scraping of algae-eating fish.</li>\n<li><em>Touch:</em> The brittle texture of dead coral; the slimy feel of algae.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.3</strong> <em>(Ocean Acidification) The water was becoming acidic.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Shells dissolving in the water; coral losing its vibrant color; a lack of shellfish in the tidepools; unusual cloudiness in the water.</li>\n<li><em>Smell:</em> A faint, sharp smell in the air; the absence of the usual salty scent.</li>\n<li><em>Touch:</em> A slight burning sensation on your skin; the weakened structure of a shell.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.4</strong> <em>(Sustainable Fishing) There were no more fish.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Empty fishing boats returning to shore; a barren seabed; a lack of movement in the water; small, juvenile fish struggling to survive.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The silence of the fishing docks; the desperate cry of a hungry seabird; the aggressive sound of large fishing vessels.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.5</strong> <em>(Marine Protected Areas) The marine park was beautiful.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Vibrant coral teeming with life; schools of fish shimmering in the sunlight; clear, turquoise water, a protected nesting site for sea turtles.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The chorus of reef fish; the gentle lapping of waves on the shore; the calls of seabirds.</li>\n<li><em>Touch:</em> The soft sand beneath your feet; the cool, clear water on your skin.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.6</strong> <em>(Fisheries Subsidies) The fishermen were angry.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Small fishing boats struggling to compete with large trawlers; empty nets; protest signs on the docks; fights and arguments.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The frustrated shouts of fishermen; the rumbling of large, subsidized vessels; the silence of the fish market.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.7</strong> <em>(Economic Benefits to Small Island Developing States) The islanders depended on the sea.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Colorful fishing boats lining the shore; children playing on the beach; traditional fishing techniques; a bustling fish market.</li>\n<li><em>Smell:</em> The salty air; the smell of fresh fish cooking; the scent of seaweed.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.a</strong> <em>(Marine Technology) Scientists were studying the ocean.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Divers collecting samples; research vessels exploring the depths; underwater robots gathering data; charts and graphs on a screen.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The hum of underwater equipment; the beeping of sonar; the excited voices of researchers.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 14.b</strong> <em>(Access for Small-Scale Artisanal Fishers) The small boats couldn’t fish.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Small, colorful fishing boats tied up at the docks; fishermen mending nets idly; large industrial fishing vessels dominating the horizon; empty fish baskets.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The mournful creaking of tied-up boats; the frustrated sighs of fishermen; the distant roar of the industrial vessels.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Target 14.c</strong> (Implementation of International Law) Countries were arguing abou the ocean.</em></li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> Representatives sitting at a conference table; raised voices and angry gestures; maps of disputed fishing territories; protest signs outside the meeting.</li>\n<li><em>Sound:</em> The heated debate in the conference room; the clicking of cameras; the chanting of protestors.</li>\n</ul><br>Step 3: Rewriting with “Show, Don’t Tell”:<br>Students rewrite the original “show, don’t tell” sentences, incorporating the sensory details and actions from the brainstorming session.<br>Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li>Use vivid language and strong verbs.</li>\n<li>Focus on specific details rather than generalization.</li>\n<li>Create a clear picture in the reader’s mind.</li>\n<li>Evoke emotions in the reader.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>The ocean was full of plastic <em>becomes:</em></li>\n<li>Plastic bags drifted like ghostly jellyfish, their translucent bodies catching the sunlight. A rainbow sheen slicked the water’s surface, and a turtle struggled to free itself from a discarded plastic ring.</li>\n<li>The coral reef was damaged <em>becomes:</em></li>\n<li>Bleached white skeletons of coral, brittle and crumbling at the touch, lay scattered across the seabed. A lone fish darted nervously between the algae-covered rocks, an eerie silence replacing the once-cibrant chorus of reef like.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

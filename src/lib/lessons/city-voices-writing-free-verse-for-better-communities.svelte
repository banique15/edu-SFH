	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to build cities and towns that are great places to live, for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities that are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Inclusive:</em> Welcoming and fair for all people.</li>\n<li><em>Safe:</em> Places where everyone feels secure.</li>\n<li><em>Resilient:</em> Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.</li>\n<li><em>Sustainable:</em> Good for the planet and for people for a long time.</li>\n</ul><br>Begin by showing a diverse range of images related to Global Goal 11.

Explain that free verse is a special kind of poetry that doesn’t follow any strict rules, like rhyming or having a certain number of syllables. Clarify that the freedom of free verse lets poets focus on telling a story or showing a feeling using vivid imagery and strong words, just like we see in the photos.

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Sensory City Snapshots"} content={"<p>Instruct students to relax, and gently close their eyes if comfortable.<br><em>Listen to the City</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Play a short (15-20 second) audio clip of a bustling city street or busy park.</li>\n<li>Instruct students to focus on what they hear, and then to let their imagination create a mental picture of the scene</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDWZkXjDYsc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City Sounds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHsjHPKuU0I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kids Playing in Park</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJQQrI7nCeY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">City Park Sounds</a></li>\n</ul><br><em>The Senses Speak</em>\n<ul>\n<li>After the clip ends, ask students to share one word or a short phrase from their mental picture that relates to a specific sense.</li>\n<li><em>Sight:</em> What is one thing you saw in your mental picture?

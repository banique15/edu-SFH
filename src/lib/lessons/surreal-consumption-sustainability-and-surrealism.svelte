	<CustomSection title={"Surrealist Techniques and Brainstorming"} content={"<p>Demonstrate and discuss key Surrealist techniques that students can incorporate into their artwork:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Juxtaposition:</em> Placing unrelated objects or images together in unexpected ways (e.g., a melting clock in a landfill).</li>\n<li><em>Displacement:</em> Removing an object from its normal context and placing it in an unusual setting (e.g., a car growing like a plant).</li>\n<li><em>Transformation:</em> Altering the form or function of an object (e.g., a plastic bottle morphing into a sea creature).</li>\n<li><em>Scale distortion:</em> Changing the size of objects to create a sense of the uncanny or emphasize their importance (e.g., a giant plastic bag overwhelming a city).</li>\n<li><em>Automatism:</em> Creating art spontaneously without conscious control, to tap into the subconcious (e.g., doodling and developing an image from the doodles).</li>\n<li><em>Dream Imagery:</em> Incorporating elements from dreams or nightmares (e.g., a landscape made of discarded food).</li>\n</ul><br>Each group brainstorms ideas for a Surrealist artwork (painting, collage, etc.) (based on available supplies) that addresses their assigned Goal or target.<br>Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li>Use symbolism and metaphor to convey their message.</li>\n<li>Experiment with different Surrealist techniques.</li>\n<li>Consider the emotional impact of their work.</li>\n<li>Connect their artwork to their own experiences and observations.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target 12.1</strong> <em>(Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns):</em> A collage depicting a city where sustainable businesses and practices coexist with unsustainable ones, highlighting the contrast and the need for change.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.2</strong> <em>(Sustainable Management of Natural Resources):</em> A painting showing a barren landscape with human hands greedily reaching for the last remaining resources, symbolizing the depletion of natural resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.3</strong> <em>(Food Waste):</em> A collage of photos of discarded food items, arranged in a visually striking but disturbing way, to represent the absurdity of food waste.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.4</strong> <em>(Environmentally Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste):</em> A drawing showing toxic chemicals seeping into a dreamlike landscape, transforming it into a polluted and distorted environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.5</strong> <em>(Substantially Reduce Waste Generation):</em> A drawing depicting everyday objects transforming into new, useful items through recycling and reuse, emphasizing the circular economy.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.6</strong> <em>(Encourage Companies to Adopt Sustainable Practices):</em> A photocollage juxtaposing images of corporate headquarters with images of environmental destruction caused by unsustainable practices, critiquing corporate responsibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.7</strong> <em>(Promote Sustainable Public Procurement):</em> A mixed-media artwork showing government buildings morphing into sustainable structures, powered by renewable energy and built with recycled materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.8</strong> <em>(Ensure Information and Awareness for Sustainable Development):</em> A painting depicting people’s heads filled with images of both unsustainable and sustainable lifestyles, symbolizing the need for education and awareness.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.a</strong> <em>(Supporting Developing Countries):</em> A collage showing hands from developed countries offering sustainable technologies to developing countries, symbolizing the transfer of knowledge and resources.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.b</strong> <em>(Sustainable Tourism):</em> An artwork showing tourists interacting with a landscape in both destructive and sustainable ways, highlighting the impact of tourism and the need for responsible travel.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 12.c</strong> <em>(Rationalize Inefficient Fossil-Fuel Subsidies):</em> A collage showing fossil-fuel products slowly being consumed by nature, symbolizing the phasing out of fossil fuels.</li>\n</ul><br>Groups develop a basic sketch or plan for their artwork, or, groups now split up and each individual plans their artwork, outlining key elements, techniques, and messages.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

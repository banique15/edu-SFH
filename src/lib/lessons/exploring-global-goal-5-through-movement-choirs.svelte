	<Introduction content={"<p>Start by asking students, How does water make you feel?<br>Allow a few moments of quiet reflection, then invite them to share their thoughts and feelings with the class.<br>Briefly explain the concept of movement choirs, where a group of people create a unified performance through synchroized movements and gestures, often incorporating spoken word or vocalization.<br><em> Simple Explanation: Imagine a group of people moving together, like a chorus, but instead of singing they're using their bodies to express ideas and emotions. That's the essence of a movement choir.<br></em> Key Features<br><em> </em>Synchronized Movement:<em> Everyone moves together, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.<br></em> <em>Expressive Gestures:</em> Using body language and facial expressions to convey emotions and ideas.<br><em> </em>Spoken Word or Vocalization:<em> Sometimes, words or sounds are incorporated to add another layer of meaning.<br></em> <em>Accessibility:</em> No prior dance experience is required; anyone can participate and contribute their own movement style.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDRXWCa0r2w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Video example of movement choir.</a><br>Re-introduce Global Goal 5 if necessary: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.<br>Highlight the importance of water for human health, ecosystems, and the planet's well-being.<br><em> </em>Human Health:<em> Hydration, hygiene, sanitation, growing food.<br></em> <em>Ecosystems:</em> Supporting diverse plant and animal life, maintaining natural balance.<br><em> </em>The Planet:<em> Regulating climate, shaping landscapes, providing resources for industries and communities.<br>Connect this to student's lives, asking questions to make it personal, such as:<br></em> How much water do you think you use in a day? Where does it come from?<br><em> Can you imagine life without clean water to drink or wash with?<br></em> How do you think water pollution affects the environment and the creatures that live in it?<br>Explain how movement choirs can be a powerful tool for expressing the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with water-related issues.<br><em> </em>Emotional Connection,<em> movement choirs can help us:<br></em> Express the emotions associated with water issues \\- joy, gratitude, anger, fear, hope.<br><em> Embody the challenges of water scarcity or pollution through movement.<br></em> Envision solutions and express the power of collective action through synchronized movement and collaborative choreography.\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine a group of people moving like a flowing river, representing the abundance and life-giving properties of water. Or, picture them huddled together, their bodies tense and constricted, symbolizing the struggle for access to clean water in a drought-striken region.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm-Up: Water's Motions"} content={"<p>Lead students through a series of guided movements that explore different qualities of water.<br><em> </em>Flowing:<em> Smooth, continuous movements like waves or currents.<br></em> <em>Stagnant:</em> Stillness, holding poses, or slow, controlled movements.<br><em> </em>Turbulent:<em> Chaotic, energetic movements, representing storms or floods.<br></em> <em>Cleansing:</em> Gentle, repetitive motions like washing hands or collecting water.<br>\\[Optional\\] Encourage students to experiment with sounds that represent water.<br><em> Dripping, trickling, flowing<br></em> Rain, storms, ocean waves<br><em> Whispers, murmurs, or chants<br>Guide students to connect specific movements (and sounds) to emotions related to water.<br></em> Joy and gratitude for clean water<br><em> Anxiety and fear during droughts or floods<br></em> Determination and hope in the face of water scarcity</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Movement Choir Creation"} content={"<p>Divide students into groups of 4-8. Assign each group one of the Global Goal 5 targets.<br>Give each group a simplified version of Global Goal 5 targets.<br>Help students understand the challenge facing their goal/target, asking questions such as:<br><em> What's the problem this goal/target is trying to solve? Who's affected? Where in the world is this happening?<br>Lead students through a movement (and sound) brainstorm, asking leading questions such as:<br></em> What body shapes/actions show this struggle (e.g., hunched over for water scarcity, frantic scrubbing for pollution)<br><em> Are there any literal gestures? (e.g., turning a faucet, washing hands)<br>If utilizing sound<br></em> What sounds represent this issue? (e.g., dripping for leaks, machinery for industrial pollution)\n<ul>\n<li>Can voices by used? (e.g., whispers for lack of access, chants for protest)</li>\n</ul><br>Guide groups to think about how the movement (and sound) can change to show progress towards the target.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Choreography and Rehearsal"} content={"<p>Suggest a simple structure<br><em> Beginning (problem)<br></em> Middle (struggle/action)<br><em> End (solution/hope)<br>Communicate to students that the movement choir choreography should be 1-2 minutes long, so key moments should be prioritized.<br>Help students focus on movement elements, such as:<br></em> <em>Unison vs. Contrast</em><br><em> Some parts can be everyone doing the same thing, others can have subgroups doing different but complementary movements to show complexity.<br></em> <em>Spatial Patterns</em><br><em> Circles can show community, lines can show journeys, clusters can represent crowding/lack of resources.<br></em> <em>Facial Expressions</em><br><em> These are essential in conveying emotion without words.<br>If using sound integration<br></em> <em>Vocalizations</em><br><em> Can be literal words, chants, or abstract sounds to create atmosphere.<br>During choreography creation, remind students that the goal is expression, not perfection.<br>Example Prompts<br></em> <em>6.1 \\- Access to Water</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Group huddled low, hands cupped as if thirsty.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Frantic searching, maybe someone collapses from exhaustion.<br><em> </em>End:<em> Eruption of joy as \"water\" is found/brought in, shared with relief.<br></em> <em>6.2 \\- Sanitation</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Chaotic movement, covering noses, showing discomfort.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Orderly lines forming, miming handwashing, building a latrine.<br><em> </em>End:<em> Proud stances, clean faces, maybe a \"tableau\" of a healthy community.<br></em> <em>6.3 \\- Water Quality</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Slow, sluggish movements, showing contamination.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Energetic scrubbing, filtering motions, purifying the \"water\".<br><em> </em>End:<em> Flowing, joyful movements, mirroring clean water, maybe bird sounds added vocally (if using sound).<br></em> <em>6.4 \\- Water Efficiency</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Restricted, tight movements, showing scarcity, maybe a \"plant\" wilting.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Careful, precise gestures of collecting/conserving (cupped hands, small steps).<br><em> </em>End:<em> Growth\\! Plant revives, movements become more expansive, showing abundance achieved through mindful use.<br></em> <em>6.5 \\- Integrated Water Management</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Groups facing off, tense postures, maybe conflicted sounds/chants (if using sound).<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Negotiation, coming together, forming a circle or linked shape.<br><em> </em>End:<em> Harmonious movement, all contributed to a shared goals (e.g., building something together).<br></em> <em>6.6 \\- Ecosystems</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Disjointed, chaotic movements, represented a damaged ecosystem.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Nurturing gestures, planting, cleaning, protecting.<br><em> </em>End:<em> Flourishing, interconnected movements, representing a restored ecosystem.<br></em> <em>6.a \\- International Cooperation</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Isolated groups, showing need but unable to help each other.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Reaching out, connecting, sharing of resources.<br><em> </em>End:<em> Unified movement, showing the strength of collaboration.<br></em> <em>6.b \\- Community Participation</em><br><em> </em>Start:<em> Individual movements, showing lack of unity.<br></em> <em>Middle:</em> Coming together, forming a group, raising voices (literally or through movement).<br><em> </em>End:* Powerful, collective movement, demonstrating community strength.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by introducing the collaborative art game “Exquisite Corpse.” Explain that the name is a bit silly, but the game is a great way to work together. The idea is simple: a group of people create a single drawing/work of art without knowing what the person before them drew.This lesson will use a simplified version of the game.<br>Show a classic example:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/33175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Untitled</em></a>, Esteban Francés, Remedios Varo, Oscar Dominguez, and Marcel Jean</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/35778?sov_referrer=art_term&amp;art_term_slug=exquisite-corpse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Figure</em></a>, André Breton, Max Morise, Jeannette Ducrocq Tanguy, Pierre Naville, Benjamin Péret, Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/35963?sov_referrer=art_term&amp;art_term_slug=exquisite-corpse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Landscape</em></a>, Valentine Hugo, André Breton, Tristan Tzara, Greta Knutson</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/36772?sov_referrer=art_term&amp;art_term_slug=exquisite-corpse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Figure</em></a>, André Breton, Jacques Hérold, Yves Tanguy, Victor Brauner</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/100669?sov_referrer=art_term&amp;art_term_slug=exquisite-corpse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Untitled</em></a>, Jake Chapman, Dinos Chapman</li>\n</ul><br><em>Demonstrate the Process</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Fold a piece of paper into three or four sections (sections correlate with the # of people in the group).

Explain that this goal is all about creating a world where everyone feel safe and is treated fairly. It’s about building strong communities and governments that are fair and honest.<br>This can be broken down into a few simple ideas:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Peace:</em> Not just an absence of war, but also feeling safe in your own neighborhood and getting along with others.</li>\n<li><em>Justice:</em> Everyone having a voice and being treated fairly under the law. It’s about being kind to each other and making sure everyone has a chance to be heard.</li>\n<li><em>Strong Institutions:</em> While this may sound like a big, complicated idea, it can be summed up by having good rules and leaders who are fair and trustworthy. Have students think about school, the principal and teachers who are fair and keep the school a safe place. That’s a strong institution, just at a smaller level.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"What is a Peaceful World Brainstorm"} content={"<p>Tell students they will participate in a brainstorming activity where they will think about what peace, justice, and community look and feel like, and connect these ideas to the ideas of Global Goal 16.<br><em>What is a Peaceful World?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to imagine they are drawing a picture for a peaceful and just world. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What would be in that picture?</li>\n<li>What would you see?</li>\n<li>What would you feel?</li>\n<li>Ask students to share their ideas, and write these on the board/large paper.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples of Words:\n<ul>\n<li>Friends playing, people shaking hands, a family eating dinner together, sharing, a clean park where everyone can play, a judge’s gavel, etc.</li>\n</ul><br>W<em>hat is a Community?</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to think about people working together.

	<CustomSection title={"Collaborative Art Project"} content={"<p>Split students into small groups (3-4 students).

The goal is to be creative and build on each other’s ideas, even if the result is unexpected or silly. The final piece will be a surprise that shows many different ideas can come together to form one whole.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Group Sharing and Interpretation"} content={"<p>After all the groups have finished their drawings, they will share them with each other (within their groups). This is a chance for students to talk about their art and see how their classmates interpreted the same ideas.<br>Ask guiding questions for groups to discuss like:\n<ul>\n<li>What did you draw in your section, and why?</li>\n<li>How does your group’s final drawing connect to the idea of peace, justice, or community?</li>\n<li>What surpirsed you about your group’s final drawing?</li>\n<li>How does the unexpected nature of this drawing show us that working together can lead to new and surprising solutions?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did this art lesson help you understand Global Goal 16 in a new way? Did it feel different from just reading about it?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about working with others on a project where you didn’t have all the control? How is that like being a part of a community?</li>\n<li>The art we made today was a collaboration.

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including brainstorming, collaborative art creation, group sharing, and discussions.</li>\n<li>Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., peace, justice, community) as demonstrated through the symbolism in the collaborative art and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in applying the “exquisite corpse” method, embracing its collaborative nature, the element of chance, and the unexpected juxtaposition of individual contributions.</li>\n<li>How clearly and powerfully the finished collaborative artwork communicates its intended message. Did the piece successfully provoke thought or emotion related to peace and justice?</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse artistic choices, and collaborating cohesively to create the shared piece.</li>\n<li>Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for social justice and the complexities of achieving peace and fairness.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

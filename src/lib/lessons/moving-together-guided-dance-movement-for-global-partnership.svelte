	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships. It means that for us to solve big problems in the world, we can’t do it alone. We need to work together as a team. This lesson will focus on how our own bodies and a shared space can show what a partnership feels like.<br>`\t`Before the movement begins, open a discussion with the class about what makes a good partnership. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How does it feel when you work with someone you trust?</li>\n<li>What are something you do to show you are working together? (e.g., listening to them, sharing ideas, helping them when they’re stuck, etc.)</li>\n<li>Can a partnership be made of people with different skills or ideas? Why is that important?</li>\n<li>How can a group of people show that they trust each other without saying a word?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Explain that guided movement meditation is a time to focus on personal feelings and bodies. The class will move gently, listening to their own bodies and the guide’s voice. The goal is to feel connected to the people in the room without even touching them.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Guided Movement Exploration"} content={"<p>`\t`Lead the class through a series of gentle movements and visualizations.

Close your eyes, or look down at the floor. Take a deep breath in, and slowly breathe out. Now, imagine that you are breathing with everyone else in the room. As we all breathe together, we are creating a shared rhythm, a shared connection.</li>\n<li><em>Connection to Global Goal 17:</em> This exercise shows how a simple, shared action can create a sense of unity and collective presence, which is the foundation of a good partnership.</li>\n<li><em>The Flow of Resources Prompt:</em> Extend one arm out in front of you. Imagine that you are holding something precious in your hand; maybe it’s an idea, or some knowledge, or a helpful tool. Now, slowly, gently, move your arm to “give” this thing to the person next to you. And now, slowly, move your other arm to “receive” something from the person on your other side.</li>\n<li><em>Connection to Global Goal 17:</em> This shows the flow of resources and support between people and countries. It’s not just about taking, but also about giving.</li>\n<li><em>The Interconnected Web Prompt:</em> Slowly, raise your hands and arms. Imagine you are building an invisible web with everyone else in the room. As you move, think about how your moements connect with the people around you. One person moves up, another moves down. How do your movements create a beautiful, tangled web of connections?</li>\n<li><em>Connection to Global Goal 17:</em> This shows how all of our individual actions and ideas are connected, like a big, beautiful web. This web is what makes a strong partnership.</li>\n<li><em>Collective Strength:</em> Slowly, lower your hands and find a strong, balanced stance. Imagine you are standing with a group of people who all want to solve a big problem. Move with strong, purposeful steps. Feel the power of the whole group moving together.</li>\n<li><em>Connection to Global Goal 17:</em> This shows the power of a collective effort. When we all work together, we can achieve great things.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with a brief introduction to the blues.<br>Explain the historical and cultural context of the blues, emphasizing its origins in African American communities and its role in expressing hardship, resilience, and hope.\n<ul>\n<li>The blues emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Deep South of the United States, particularly in the Mississippi Delta. It originated from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, and chants of enslaved and newly freed African Americans.</li>\n<li>The blues became a way to express the hardships of life: poverty, discrimination, injustice, and lost love. It also served as a form of resilience, a way to find hope and strength in the face of adversity.</li>\n<li>Key figures like Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, and Muddy Waters played a crucial role in shaping the blues sound and spreading its influence.</li>\n<li>The blues is more than just music; it is a way of telling a story and expressing emotion.</li>\n</ul><br>Discuss the basic structure of the blues (12-bar blues, AAB lyric form, blues scale).\n<ul>\n<li><em>12-Bar Blues:</em> The most common blues structure consists of 12 bars (measures). It follows a specific chord progression: I-I-I-I, IV-IV-I-I, V-IV-I-V (or I). This progression creates a sense of tension and release that is characteristic of the blues.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3AbKYn0gwY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simple 12-Bar Blues Backing Track</a> to follow the progression.</li>\n<li><em>AAB Lyric Form:</em> Blues lyrics typically follow an AAB pattern. The first line (A) is a statement of a problem or feeling. The second line (A) repeats or slightly varies the first line. The third line (B) provides a resolution, reflection, or punchline. This form creates a sense of storytelling and emotional depth.</li>\n<li><em>Blues Scale (can discuss depending on class and knowledge of music):</em> The blues scale is a variation of the pentatonic scale with added ‘blue notes’ (flattened third, fifth, and seventh notes). These blue notes give the blues its characteristic sound, conveying a sense of melancholy and emotion.</li>\n</ul><br>Play examples of classic blues songs, highlighting the emotional depth and storytelling aspect of the genre.<br><em>Examples (all using 12-bar blues):</em>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtDlZdhHRCI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Cross Road Blues” by Robert Johnson</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXe1HH1LK-o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Moving” by Howlin’ Wolf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Ua1kqcmaY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Hoochie Coochie Man” by Muddy Waters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmpwvxW0gW0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Hound Dog” by Big Mama Thornton</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vchl9yUo3Fo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Mean Old Bedbug Blues” by Bessie Smith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6hQ9HSKlIE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Give Me One Reason” by Tracy Chapman</a></li>\n</ul><br>Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 11. Explain the goal’s focus on creating inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and communities.<br>Divide students into groups and assign each group one or two specific targets from Goal 11, or allow them to focus on the Goal as a whole.<br>Give each group time to research and discuss their assigned goal/targets/indicators, focusing on local relevance.<br>`\t`<em>Example:</em> Group working on target 11.6 discusses their experience with the local recycling program, and that many apartment buildings do not have access to recycling bins.<br>Connect the blues to Global Goal 11. Explain how the blues can be a powerful tool for expressing the challenges and hopes related to sustainable cities. Emphasize that the blues has historically given voice to the underrepresented, and this lesson will use the blues to give voice to the issues surrounding sustainable cities.</p>"} />

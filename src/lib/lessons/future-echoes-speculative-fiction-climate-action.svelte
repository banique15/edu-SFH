	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with an engaging introduction to Speculative Fiction. Explain that it’s a genre that explores possibilities beyond the reality we know.<br>Highlight its key characteristics:\n<ul>\n<li>Imagining alternative futures, worlds, or societies.</li>\n<li>Exploring “what if” scenarios.</li>\n<li>Addressing social, political, and ethical issues through fictional lenses.</li>\n<li>Encompassing genres like science fiction, fantasy, dystopian, utopian, and climate fiction (cli-fi).</li>\n</ul><br>Share short excerpts from diverse speculative fiction texts, focusing on:\n<ul>\n<li>Different subgenres and their approaches.</li>\n<li>The power of speculative fiction to raise awareness and spark critical thinking.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>“The Water Knife” by Paolo Bacigalupi</li>\n<li>This excerpt sets the stage for water scarcity and social tension in the novel. It immediately establishes the stakes and the harsh reality of a climate-changed world. It’s engaging and introduces a morally complex character. It connects to Global Goal 13 by showing a potential consequence of inaction.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`\"Angel Velasquez was a water knife, and that meant he was a scavenger. He worked for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and most days his job was simple: find water, open the tap, and make sure that the water kept flowing south. But some days, like today, it meant something else. It meant cutting off someone else's water. Turning off the tap. Making sure that someone else went dry. And those were the days when people died. The water wars had been going on for years. State against state, city against city, neighbor against neighbor. It was a slow-motion apocalypse, a parched and desperate unraveling of the West. And Angel was one of its harbingers.\"\n<ul>\n<li>“Parable of the Sower” by Octavia E. Butler</li>\n<li>This excerpt gives a sense of the social breakdown and environmental degradation in Butler’s near-future California. It is powerful and evocative. It highlights the social justice dimensions of climate change.</li>\n</ul><br>\"The world is changing. You can feel it in the air. You can see it in the streets. You can smell it in the smoke. The government's gone. The rich are walled in, and the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves. It's a war out there. A slow, grinding war of attrition. The Earth is dying, and we're dying with it.\"\n<ul>\n<li>“Flight Behavior” by Barbara Kingsolver</li>\n<li>This excerpt introduces the central myster of the novel, the appearance of monarch butterflies in an unexpected location, and hints at the underlying climate change cause.</li>\n</ul><br>\"Dellarobia had come to think of the mountain as her own personal problem. She was accustomed to the way things changed up there. The way the trees changed color, the way the light changed. But this was different. This was… wrong. The mountain was on fire. Not in the way of a forest fire, with flames and smoke. But in a different way. It was as if the trees themselves had turned into fire. The trees were full of butterflies.\"\n<ul>\n<li>“The Ministry for the Future” by Kim Stanley Robinson</li>\n<li>This excerpt conveys the urgency of the climate crisis.</li>\n</ul><br>\"The CO2 was still accumulating in the sky; the temperature was still rising; the ice was still melting; the sea was still rising; the weather was still changing; the storms were still raging; the droughts were still spreading; the fires were still burning; the people were still suffering; the species were still going extinct. And the only thing that was changing fast enough to keep up with the rate of all that was the rate of human denial.\"<br>Facilitate a brief discussion:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some examples of speculative fiction you’re familiar with?</li>\n<li>What makes speculative fiction so compelling and thought provoking?</li>\n<li>How can speculative fiction help us explore complex issues like climate change?</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.<br>Emphasize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action. Briefly review targets and indicators if wanted.<br>Engage students in a thought-provoking discussion about how speculative fiction can be used to explore climate change. Ask questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can we use speculative fiction to visualize the potential consequences of climate change?</li>\n<li>Can speculative fiction empower us to take action and advocate for change?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Exploring Speculative Fiction Techniques and Brainstorming"} content={"<p>Demonstrate and discuss key speculative fiction techniques that students can incorporate into their writing:\n<ul>\n<li><em>World-building:</em> Creating detailed and believable future worlds affected by climate change.</li>\n<li><em>Character development:</em> Exploring how individuals and communities adapt (or fail to adapt) to climate change.</li>\n<li><em>Plot and conflict:</em> Developing storylines that revole around climate-related challenges and solutions.</li>\n<li><em>Scientific extrapolation:</em> Basing fictional storylines that revolve around climate-related challenges and solutions.</li>\n<li><em>Social commentary:</em> Using fiction to critique current policies, behaviors, or societal structures.</li>\n</ul><br>Each student brainstorms ideas for a short speculative fiction story (1-3 pages) that addresses Global Goal 13. Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a specific climate change impact or solution to focus on.</li>\n<li>Develop a compelling setting, characters, and plot.</li>\n<li>Incorporate elements of scientific extrapolation and social commentary.</li>\n<li>Consider the emotional impact of their story.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples of speculative fiction concepts:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Target 13.1</strong> <em>(Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity)</em></li>\n<li>A story about a community that builds innovative and resilient infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.</li>\n<li>A story about a group of climate refugees forced to migrate due to rising sea levels or desertification.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 13.2</strong> <em>(Integrate climate change measures)</em></li>\n<li>A story set in a future where climate change measures are fully integrated into national policies and daily life.</li>\n<li>A dystopian story about a society where climate change is ignored, leading to social collapse and environmental devastation.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 13.3</strong> <em>(Improve education and awareness)</em></li>\n<li>A story about a young person who uses technology and storytelling to educate their community about climate change.</li>\n<li>A story that explores the challenges of communicating climate science and overcoming misinformation.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 13.a</strong> <em>(Mobilize finance)</em></li>\n<li>A story about a global initiative to fund climate adaptation projects in developing countries.</li>\n<li>A story that critiques the financial barriers to climate action and the role of economic inequality.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 13.b</strong> <em>(Promote mechanisms for capacity-building)</em></li>\n<li>A story about a program that empowers women, youth, and marginalized communities to participate in climate change planning and management.</li>\n<li>A story that explores the importance of indigenous knowledge and traditional practices in climate adaptation.</li>\n</ul><br>Students develop a basic outline or plot summary for their speculative fiction story.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Story Writing"} content={"<p>Students write their speculative fiction stories, incorporating the techniques and concepts discussed. Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li>Create vivid and detailed descriptions of their future world.</li>\n<li>Develop compelling and relatable characters.</li>\n<li>Craft a plot that is engaging and thought-provoking.</li>\n<li>Use strong language and imagery to convey their message.</li>\n<li>Explore the ethical and social dimensions of climate change.</li>\n</ul><br>Provide guidance, support, and feedback as needed.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Sharing and Discussion"} content={"<p>If time allows, students share their stories with the class (either by reading full story, excerpts, or summarizing the plot).

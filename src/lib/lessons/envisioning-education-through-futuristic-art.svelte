	<Introduction content={"<p>Start by asking students “Imagine you could wave a magic wand and redesign your school. What would you change? What would the ideal school of the future look like?” Give them a few minutes to jot down ideas, then share with a partner or small group.<br>Open the discussion to the whole class. Write down key ideas on the board. Expect to hear things like “no homework\\!” but try to steer the conversation towards more visionary thinking. Examples:<br><em> Instead of just asking “What would you change” ask:<br></em> If you could invent any technology to help you learn, what would it be?<br><em> Imagine schools existed on Mars, how would they be different?<br></em> If school was designed to solve the world’s biggest problems, what would it look like?<br><em> Still acknowledge “no homework” type answers, but then respond with something like:<br></em> “Let’s think even bigger. What if school was so engaging, you wanted to keep learning even after the bell rings?”<br>Potential Examples of Answers<br><em> Learning Environment<br></em> Outdoor classrooms<br><em> Learning pods in communities<br></em> Smart board that adapt to each student<br><em> AI generated lessons<br></em> Sensory rooms<br><em> Flexible spaces for inclusivity<br></em> Tech that bridges language barriers<br><em> Curriculum and Teaching<br></em> Project-based learning<br><em> Real-world connections<br></em> Student-led inquiries<br><em> Personalized support<br></em> Less lecturing, more doing<br><em> Beyond the Classroom<br></em> Virtual guest speakers<br><em> Global collaborative projects<br></em> Service-learning projects<br><em> Social entrepreneurship<br></em> Lifelong access to education<br><em> Reskilling opportunities<br>Now discuss/review the theme. “All these ideas about the future of education are exciting, but did you know there’s a global effort to make education better for everyone?

This can be visually exciting for students, and ties into the idea of progress and change that's inherent in envisioning the future.<br><em> </em>Focus on Technology:<em> Futuristic art often incorporated images of machines, airplanes, cars, etc. This can spark discussion about how tech will shape education (for better or worse).<br></em> <em>Not Just \"Pretty\":</em> Some Futurist works are intentionally jarring or unsettling. This can be a good conversation starter about the complex emotions the future can evoke (hope, fear, excitement).<br><em> </em>Beyond the Italian Movement:<em> While Italian Futurism is most famous, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, etc. Showing this variety demonstrates that imagining the future is a universal human urge.<br>Questions to Deepen Discussion<br></em> Even if students don't like a particular piece, ask: \"What about this makes it feel 'futuristic'?\"<br><em> \"If this painting was about school, what might it be saying?\" (Even abstract works can spark ideas)<br></em> \"Do you think the Futurists were optimistic or pessimistic about the future? How can you tell?\"<br><em> \"Can we learn anything from Futurism about how to approach problems today, even if their style is old?\"<br>Discussion<br></em> What elements make this art feel “futuristic”?<br><em> How do these artists imagine the future of technology, society, and education?<br></em> What emotions or ideas do these artworks evoke in you?</p>"} {sdgColor} />

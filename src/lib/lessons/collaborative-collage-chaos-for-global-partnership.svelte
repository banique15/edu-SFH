This stemmed from several factors.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Shared Anarchy and Disillusionment:</em> Dada artists were united by their shared outrage at the war and the perceived failrues of bourgeois society. This common ground naturally led to artists working together, finding strength and validation in their collective dissent. Creating art together became a way to amplify their message and build a sense of community within their movement.</li>\n<li><em>Rejection of the Individual Genius Myth:</em> Dada challenged the traditional Romantic idea of the solitary artistic genius. They often embraced chance, the readymade, and collaborative processes as a way to undermine the notion of individual artistic mastery and intention. By creating art collectively, they emphasized the role of the group and the unexpected outcomes that could arise from shared creation, rather than the singular vision of one artist.</li>\n<li><em>Experimentation and Play:</em> Dada was fundamentally experimental and playful. Collaborative activities provided a fertile ground for exploring new ideas and techniques, without the constraints of individual ego or preconceived notions.</li>\n<li><em>Building a Movement:</em> Collaboration was also a practical way for Dada artists to build and sustain their movement. By working together on exhibitions, publications, and performances, they created a stronger collective voice and gained more visibility. These collaborative efforts helped to solidify Dada as a significant force in the art world, even if its core tenet was anti-establishment.</li>\n<li><em>Shared Authorship:</em> The traditional notion of a single author or artist was often dissolved in collaborative Dada projects. The final artwork became a product of the group’s interaction, with individual contributions merging into something new and often surprising.</li>\n<li><em>Embracing the Unexpected:</em> Because Dada often incorporated chance and the input of multiple individuals, the outcomes of collective creation were frequently unpredictable. This embrace of the unexpected was a key element of the Dada aesthetic, reflecting their view of a chaotic and irrational world.</li>\n<li><em>Breaking Down Boundaries:</em> Collaborative Dada activities blurred the lines between different art forms (poetry, visual art, performance) and also between artists themselves. This interdisciplinary and collaborative spirit was a way of challenging artistic conventions and exploring new possibilities for creative expression.</li>\n<li><em>Social Interaction as Art:</em> For Dadaists, the act of creating together was often as important as the final product. The interactions, the disagreements, the unexpected connections that arose during collaborative sessions were all part of the artistic experience.</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

However, think about how Dada artists challenged existing norms and created something new through collaboration and unexpected combinations.</li>\n<li>Today, we’ll explore collaborative Dada collage as a way to think about how diverse elements - different perspectives, resources, ideas - can be brought together, sometimes in surprising ways, to build the partnerships needed for a sustainable future.</li>\n<li>Just as Dada artists combined disparate materials to create new meanings, we’ll work together to create collaborative collages that might spark fresh perspectives on global cooperation and the unexpected power of diverse contributions.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

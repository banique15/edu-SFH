	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by introducing the concept of a rhythm. Explain that a rhythm is a pattern of sounds. We hear rhythms everywhere in nature, from the tapping of a woodpecker to the pitter-patter of rain.<br>Then, introduce Global Goal 15. Explain that this goal is about protecting all the different kinds of life on land, from the animals in a forest to the plants in a desert. This lesson will focus on how rhythm can tell the story of a healthy ecosystem, and what happens when that rhythm is broken.<br>Introduce the game Rhythm Telephone. Explain that one person will create a short, simple rhythmic pattern (e.g. clap, snap, stomp) and pass it to the person next to them. That person will then try to repeat the rhythm exactly as they heard it and pass it to the next person.<br>The game continues until the rhythm gets back to the very first person. The challenge is to see if the rhythm stays the same or if it changes as it’s passed around the group.<br>Demonstrate a simple rhythm, like:\n<ul>\n<li>Clap, clap, stomp</li>\n<li>Snap, clap, clap</li>\n<li>Stomp, stomp, clap</li>\n</ul><br>Have a few students practice repeating and passing the rhythm.</p>"} />

Have the class sit in a circle.<br><em>The Healthy Ecosystem</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students what sounds they think they would hear in a healthy ecosystem, and prompt them to create a rhythm for it together, using items in the rhythm starter bag.</li>\n<li>Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to a healthy ecosystem.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Pull out a smooth stone. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What rhythm does a smooth, solid rock make?</li>\n<li>A student called on can create a steady, calm rhythm by tapping their leg or desk.</li>\n<li>Pull out a toy animal. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What rhythm does a deer running through a field make?</li>\n<li>A student volunteer can create a light, quick rhythm using their feet or hands.</li>\n<li>Have a student volunteer choose a rhythm starter item and create a rhythm. The class can listen and try to repeat the rhythm as a whole group. This helps students feel the rhythm and connect it to a healthy ecosystem.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Threat</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students what happens when a threat enters an ecosystem, and how they think the rhythm might change?</li>\n<li>Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to an ecosystem encountering a threat.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Pull out a crinkled leaf. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What rhythm does a dry, fragile leaf make when it’s stepped on?</li>\n<li>A student called on can create a sharp, brittle rhythm.</li>\n<li>Have a student volunteer create a rhythm that sounds “unhealthy” or “broken.” The class can listen and try to pass this rhythm around the circle.</li>\n<li>Encourage the class to listen for how the rhythm might get distorted or changed as it’s passed on (and don’t encourage them to correct). This can help them understand how a threat can disrupt a system.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Restoration</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students how they think a rhythm of hope and healing can be created?</li>\n<li>Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to an ecosystem healing.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Pull out a small twig. Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What does planting a new tree sound like?</li>\n<li>A student volunteer can create a strong, simple rhythm to represent planting.</li>\n<li>Have a student volunteer create a rhythm for healing and restoration. Pass this rhythm around the circle. See if this time, the class can keep this rhythm strong and true, which shows the power of a collective effort.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

You can have one group perform their healthy ecosystem rhythm, and another perform their restoration rhythm. Based on students’ needs and abilities, change the tempo and volume to create a dynamic performance.<br>The goal is to create a collective piece that tells a story about the challenges and hope for life on land.

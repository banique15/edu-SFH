	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 6, Clean Water and Sanitation.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 6 means everyone, everywhere, has access to clean water for drinking, washing, and playing, and safe ways to keep our environments clean (like good restrooms and trash disposal). Emphasize that this means healthy rivers, lakes, and oceans, and clean hands for all.<br>Explain to students that writers are artists (like painters, sculptors, etc.) but instead of brushes, colors, or clay, they use words to create pictures in the reader's mind. Clarify that descriptive writing helps readers \"see,\" \"hear,\" \"feel,\" \"smell,\" and even \"taste\" a scene, making it come alive.<br>Tell the class that today, they will all become word painters, using their senses to write powerful descriptions about water; whether it's clean and beautiful, or facing challenges, or showing how people can help!<br>Begin by showing the class images of contrasting water environments (polluted vs. pristine).<br>Examples:<br><em>Pristine</em>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/visiting-plitvice-lakes-national-park-in-croatia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wendyperrin.com/?destination=tahiti-insiders-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bora Bora, French Polynesia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.safaribookings.com/blog/victoria-falls-zambia-vs-zimbabwe-which-side-is-better\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Victoria Falls, Zambia/Zimbabwe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.russiabeyond.com/travel/332795-myth-busting-lake-baikal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lake Baikal, Russia</a></li>\n</ul><br><em>Polluted</em>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ecohubmap.com/hot-spot/pollution-of-the-yangtze-river/178xvrml7n2wlmf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yangtze River, China</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@seansarmiento44/pasig-river-is-it-too-late-b9e9dae61cbe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pasig River, Philippines</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24632890-900-lake-victoria-is-at-risk-of-dying-from-pollution-and-climate-change/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lake Victoria, East Africa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-shrinkage-of-the-Dead-Sea_fig1_344219537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Dead Sea, Israel/Jordan</a></li>\n</ul><br>Open a discussion with guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How do these images make you feel?

What do you see in the polluted pictures that makes it look unhealthy?</li>\n<li>Why is having clean water and clean ways to get rid of waste so important for people and for the environment?</li>\n<li>Do you think descriptive words can make someone really feel the importance of clean water? How?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"My Water Story"} content={"<p>Give each student a piece of paper or have them write in their journals, etc.<br>Explain that they will choose one scenario (a challenge with water OR a hopeful solution) from the brainstormed grid. They will write a short descriptive piece (about 1-2 paragraphs) that brings that specific scene to life using their words.<br>Encourage students to use:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Strong verbs:</em> sparkled, gurgled, trudged, shimmered, choked, flowed, tangled, erupted, etc.</li>\n<li><em>Descriptive adjectives:</em> crystal clear, parched, slimy, vibrant, heavy, joyous, resilient.</li>\n<li><em>Show, Don't Tell:</em> Instead of saying \"The water was dirty,\" describe its \"muddy brown swirls\" and the \"slippery green moss\" coating the stones.

	<CustomSection title={"Sharing and Wordsmithing"} content={"<p>Have students pair up or form small groups (3-4 students).<br>Instruct them to take turns reading their descriptive writing pieces aloud to their partner/groups.<br>As they listen, encourage peers to identify and praise specific sensory details that are particularly vivid or effective. Gently guide students to offer suggestions for improvement, focusing on how to further enhance the sensory experience for the reader.<br>Example Feedback Prompts:\n<ul>\n<li>I love how you described [specific detail from a sense]. It made me really feel like I was there. Which sense did you focus on most?</li>\n<li>I could almost [hear/feel/see/etc.] [specific detail]. How did you think of that particular word?</li>\n<li>Could you add a [smell/taste/etc.] to this part to make it even stronger?</li>\n<li>What feeling did you want your words to create for me? Can you tell me more about that?</li>\n<li>Your writing painted a clear picture of [clean water/pollution/helping]. What words helped you do that?</li>\n</ul><br>Then, invite a few volunteers to share one sentence from their writing that they are particularly proud of, or one idea they got from their partner's feedback.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did focusing on sensory details (what you can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste) change how you thought about clean water and sanitation?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about how powerful words can be to make someone really feel what it's like to have clean water, or to face pollution?</li>\n<li>Which descriptions from your classmates' writing made you think or feel the most about clean water, and why?</li>\n<li>What does this activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation?</li>\n<li>What's one small action you feel inspired to take this week to help keep water clean or save water?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, individual process, and class discussions (both sharing and listening).</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of clean water and sanitation (access, hygiene, pollution prevention), as demonstrated through the thematic content and sensory details in the descriptive writing and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in crafting vivid descriptive pieces. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 6 (does the writing clearly depict a scene related to clean water, pollution, or solutions?), use of sensory detail (does the writing effectively engage at least three sense to bring the scene to life?), and strong language (are strong verbs and descriptive adjectives used to enhance the impact?).</li>\n<li>Ability to provide thoughtful, specific, and supportive feedback to peers, focusing on sensory effectiveness.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

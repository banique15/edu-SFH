	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. Explain that it's about making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.<br>Explain to students that journal writing (or keeping a diary) is a special kind of writing. Clarify that it's a personal space where you can write down thoughts, feelings, and experiences, like talking to a trusted friend. Sometimes, writing in a journal can help to understand big feelings, process challenging moments, or even explore important ideas about the world, like fairness. Explain that today, they will all write fictional journal entries to explore fairness and hwo everyone deserves to feel included and respected.<br>Begin by sharing a thought-provoking quote, image, or short video clip related to inequality.<br>Examples:<br><em> \"Inequality is the root of social evil.\" - Pope Francis<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-45257901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Images depicting the stark contrast between wealthy and impoverished communities.</a><br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpu_6sFk_78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Youth standing up against racism - a future of race equality is within our grasp</a><br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nOJf_95m4I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Norms and the Gender Wage Gap</a><br>Open the conversation with guiding questions like:<br><em> What does this image/video/quote make you think about fairness and how people are treated?<br></em> What are some examples of fairness or unfairness that you have seen or experienced in your own life?<br><em> Why do you think it's important that everyone has equal chances and feels included?<br>Introduce the purpose and benefits of journal writing for this lesson:<br></em> <em>A Safe Space:</em> It's a place to explore your true thoughts and feelings.<br><em> </em>Understanding Ideas:<em> It can help to think more deeply about big ideas like fairness and how they affect people.<br></em> <em>Telling Stories:</em> It's a way to tell personal stories, even fictional ones, that can help others understand.<br>Show selected examples of age-appropriate journal entries and discuss how they convey feelings and thoughts.<br>Examples:<br><em> </em>The Diary of a Young Girl,<em> Anne Frank<br></em> \"I sometimes wonder if anyone will ever understand what I  mean, if anyone will ever overlook my ingratitude and not worry about whether or not I'm Jewish and merely see me as a teenager badly in need of some good plain fun.\" December 24, 1943<br><em> \"These poor people are being shipped off to filthy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick and neglected cattle.\" October 9, 1942<br></em> \"I long to ride a bike, dance, whistle, look at the world, feel young and know that I'm free, and yet I can't let it show.\" December 24, 1943<br><em> \"We aren't allowed to have an opinion! My, my, aren't they progressive! Not have an opinion! People can tell you to shut up, but they can't keep you from having an opinion. You can't forbid someone to have an opinion, no matter how young they are!\" September 27, 1942<br></em> <em>Journal of Charlotte Forten, Free Woman of Color,</em> Charlotte L. Forten, September 12, 1855<br><em> \"I wonder that every colored person is not a misanthrope. Surely we have everything to make us hate mankind. I have met girls in the schoolroom — they have been thoroughly kind and cordial to me, — perhaps the next day met them in the street — they feared to recognize me; these I can but regard now with scorn and contempt…These are but trifles, certainly, to the great, public wrongs which we as a people are obliged to endure. But to those who experience them, these apparent trifles are most wearing and discouraging; even to the child's mind they reveal volumes of deceit and heartlessness, and early teach a lesson of suspicion and distrust.\"<br></em> <em>The Depression Diary of Mrs. Clara Ackerman,</em> Clara Ackerman, 1932<br><em> \"The past year of 1931 will go into history with memories of struggles to meet taxes and loan payments, also cash rent, with prices of farm products going lower and lower toward the close of the year.\"<br></em> \"Hens are worth 8 cents on the market; would like to sell encough to get some dress shoes and Frank a good shirt, as he only has had one all summer, and a pair of rayon bloomers for the girls and some little thing for Dale. Then if there should be any left, would like to make another payment on Lois' doctor bill.\"<br>Discuss with guiding questions like:<br><em> What do you notice about how these journal entries show what the person/character is thinking or feeling?<br></em> How do they make the person/character feel real?</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Feeling Face and Word Match"} content={"<p>Prepare students with paper and a writing utensil. Explain that they will quietly observe the images that will be displayed.<br><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNmDMF1WSc5i2AWC7jGiKK6RPF8LnNfQ?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Example Images</a><br><em>See the Feeling</em><br><em> Display (can be printed, on a projector, etc.) an image of a clear facial expression showing a distinct emotion (e.g., a happy face).<br></em> Tell students what the feeling is that goes along with this face.<br><em> Ask students to write down:<br></em> What other feelings do you see in this face?<br><em> What words come to mind that describe these feelings?<br></em> Invite a few students to share their ideas.<br><em>Explore the Cause</em><br><em> Ask students to write down:<br></em> What might make someone feel this way?<br><em> What's a short, simple situation that could cause this feeling?<br></em>Contrast and Connect<em><br></em> Repeat the process with a contrasting emotion (e.g., a worried face).<br><em> Ask students to write down:<br></em> What feelings do you see here?<br><em> What words describe it?<br></em> What might make someone feel this way?<br><em> What's a simple solution?<br></em> Invite a few students to share their ideas.<br><em>More Feelings</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Show 2-3 more diverse facial expressions, briefly asking for students to share their ideas, focusing on the feelings.</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude warm up by affirming students' ability to identify and describe feelings, something that will be important and will come alive in their upcoming journal entries.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"My Equality Journal"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with one pre-written Inclusion/Exclusion Scenario Card.<br><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19P2_1ZApmkis0UNM5oY98SwZuaCSsOIcYmxrTbbhDIA/edit?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inclusion/Exclusion Scenario Card Examples</a><br>Instruct groups to read their card. Then, guide them to brainstorm:<br><em> </em>The Character:<em> Who is the person experiencing this? What is their name? How old are they (roughly)? What kind of person are they (e.g., shy, outgoing, curious)?<br></em> <em>The Scenario Details:</em> What exactly happens in this situation? What do they see, hear, or feel?<br><em> </em>The Journal Voice:<em> If this character were writing in their journal, how would their voice sound? Would they be angry, sad, hopeful, determined, confused, happy? What kind of words would they use to show that feeling?<br></em> <em>The \"I Wish\" or \"I Hope\":</em> What would this character wish for or hope for in this situation about fairness or inclusion?<br>Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:<br><em> How would a shy character write about being left out differently from an outgoing one?<br></em> What sounds would this character hear in this unfair situation?\n<ul>\n<li>What specific words would show their frustration or their hope?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Exploring Journal Writing Techniques"} content={"<p>Explain that great fictional journal writing uses special techniques to make entries feel real and impactful.<br><em> </em>Clear Voice and Perspective:<em> A fictional journal entry should sound like a real person talking with their own unique voice.<br></em> Ask:<br><em> If your character is excited, how would their words sound differently from when they're worried?<br></em> How do they use words to show their personality?<br><em> </em>Vivid Details and Sensory Descriptions:<em> Fictional journal entries feel real when they include details about what the character sees, hears, smells, tastes, and touches.<br></em> Ask:<br><em> Instead of saying \"The playground was unfair,\" how could your character describe what they saw or heard that made it unfair?<br></em> <em>Deeper Thoughts and Reflections:</em> Journals are also for thinking about why things happen and what characters really feel deep inside, or what they hope for.<br><em> Ask:<br></em> What does your character think about when they'r lying in bed at night after something unfair happened?\n<ul>\n<li>What do they wish for?</li>\n</ul><br>Guide students to think about how these techniques will make their fictional journal entries come alive.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Journal Writing"} content={"<p>Explain that each student will now write their own fictional journal entry (about 1-2 paragraphs) from the perspective of a character who experiences something related to Global Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities. They can use the scenario from their group's brainstorm, or choose another idea. Note: If better for students to have more guidance, have each student stick to their group's scenario.<br>Instruct students to:<br><em> </em>Choose a Character:<em> Decide who is writing the journal entry, if someone different from their scenario character (e.g., a child, a robot, an animal, a wise elder, a new student).<br></em> <em>Choose a Date:</em> Give the entry a date (e.g., October 26th 1992, Wednesday, Day 1 of the new school year).<br><em> </em>Focus on a Moment:<em> Write about one specific event or feeling about fairness/unfairness/inclusion/exclusion.<br></em> <em>Show Feelings and Thoughts:</em> Use the techniques explored (clear voice, vivid details, deeper thoughts) to make the character's feelings and inner thoughts come alive.<br><em> </em>Conclude with a Reflection or Hope:<em> End the entry with what the character learned, what they wish for, or what they hope for in the future.<br>Circulate, offering support and guidance as they write. Ask guiding questions like:<br></em> How does your character's voice sound in this entry? Is it a happy voice? A worried voice?<br><em> Can you add a detail about what your character saw or heard that made them feel sad/happy/confused/etc.?<br></em> What is your character thinking about in this unfair situation? What do they hope will happen next?\n<ul>\n<li>Are you making sure to use words that really show the feelings, not just tell them?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

What made it stand out?","How did this/your partner's entry make you feel or think differently about global Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities?","What were some of the common themes that emerged in the entries?","How did the authors use a clear voice, vivid details, or deeper thoughts to make their characters and stories feel real?","What did you learn about the power of personal stories (even fictional ones) to show what fairness and inequality mean?","Did any entry make you feel more empathetic or connected to someone who might experience unfairness?","What was one creative way an author showed a character's feelings or thoughts?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<ReflectionQuestions questions={["How did writing a fictional journal entry from a specific perspective help you understand the personal impact of inequality in a deeper way?","What did you learn about the emotions and daily realities associated with inequality that you might not have grasped from just reading facts or statistics?","Did the act of creating a character's inner world through journal writing spark new feelings of empathy or connection to those experiencing inequality?","How did using a journal format - a personal, reflective space - help you explore your thoughts and feelings about fairness and equality?","What new insights did you gain about the scope and complexity of Global Goal 10 after this lesson?","What role do you think creative writing and personal storytelling can play in raising awareness about inequality and inspiring action?","What's one specific action, big or small, that you feel inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to achieving Global Goal 10?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<AssessmentCriteria criteria={["Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, the individual writing process, and discussions.","Understanding of the core concept of reduced inequalities (fairness, equal opportunity, inclusion, respect for all), as demonstrated through the narrative and thematic content of the fictional journal entry and verbal explanations.","Originality and effectiveness in applying journal writing elements. Look for clear voice and perspective (does the entry sound like a distinct character, conveying thoughts and feelings?), vivid details (are there attempts to use sensory details or specific observations to make th entry feel real?), reflection/emotion (does the entry explore the character's thoughts about the situation and convey their emotions effectively?), and connection to Global Goal 10 (does the entry clearly explore a situation related to fairness, inclusion, or inequality?).","Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion."]} {sdgColor} />

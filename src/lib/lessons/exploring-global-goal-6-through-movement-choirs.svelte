	<Introduction content={"<p>**\\<br>`\t`Start by asking students, How does water make you feel?<br>`\t`Allow a few moments of quiet reflection, then invite them to share their thoughts and feelings with the class.<br>`\t`Briefly explain the concept of movement choirs, where a group of people create a unified performance through synchroized movements and gestures, often incorporating spoken word or vocalization.\n<ul>\n<li>Simple Explanation: Imagine a group of people moving together, like a chorus, but instead of singing they're using their bodies to express ideas and emotions. That's the essence of a movement choir.</li>\n<li>Key Features</li>\n<li><em>Synchronized Movement:</em> Everyone moves together, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.</li>\n<li><em>Expressive Gestures:</em> Using body language and facial expressions to convey emotions and ideas.</li>\n<li><em>Spoken Word or Vocalization:</em> Sometimes, words or sounds are incorporated to add another layer of meaning.</li>\n<li><em>Accessibility:</em> No prior dance experience is required; anyone can participate and contribute their own movement style.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDRXWCa0r2w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Video example of movement choir.</a><br>`\t`Re-introduce Global Goal 6 if necessary: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.<br>`\t`Highlight the importance of water for human health, ecosystems, and the planet's well-being.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Human Health:</em> Hydration, hygiene, sanitation, growing food.</li>\n<li><em>Ecosystems:</em> Supporting diverse plant and animal life, maintaining natural balance.</li>\n<li><em>The Planet:</em> Regulating climate, shaping landscapes, providing resources for industries and communities.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Connect this to student's lives, asking questions to make it personal, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>How much water do you think you use in a day? Where does it come from?</li>\n<li>Can you imagine life without clean water to drink or wash with?</li>\n<li>How do you think water pollution affects the environment and the creatures that live in it?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Explain how movement choirs can be a powerful tool for expressing the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with water-related issues.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Emotional Connection,</em> movement choirs can help us:</li>\n<li>Express the emotions associated with water issues - joy, gratitude, anger, fear, hope.</li>\n<li>Embody the challenges of water scarcity or pollution through movement.</li>\n<li>Envision solutions and express the power of collective action through synchronized movement and collaborative choreography.</li>\n<li>Imagine a group of people moving like a flowing river, representing the abundance and life-giving properties of water. Or, picture them huddled together, their bodies tense and constricted, symbolizing the struggle for access to clean water in a drought-striken region.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm-Up: Water's Motions"} content={"<p>**\\<br>`\t`Lead students through a series of guided movements that explore different qualities of water.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Flowing:</em> Smooth, continuous movements like waves or currents.</li>\n<li><em>Stagnant:</em> Stillness, holding poses, or slow, controlled movements.</li>\n<li><em>Turbulent:</em> Chaotic, energetic movements, representing storms or floods.</li>\n<li><em>Cleansing:</em> Gentle, repetitive motions like washing hands or collecting water.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`[Optional] Encourage students to experiment with sounds that represent water.\n<ul>\n<li>Dripping, trickling, flowing</li>\n<li>Rain, storms, ocean waves</li>\n<li>Whispers, murmurs, or chants</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Guide students to connect specific movements (and sounds) to emotions related to water.\n<ul>\n<li>Joy and gratitude for clean water</li>\n<li>Anxiety and fear during droughts or floods</li>\n<li>Determination and hope in the face of water scarcity</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Movement Choir Creation"} content={"<p>**\\<br>`\t`Divide students into groups of 4-8. Assign each group one of the Global Goal 6 targets.<br>`\t`Give each group a simplified version of Global Goal 6 targets.<br>`\t`Help students understand the challenge facing their goal/target, asking questions such as:\n<ul>\n<li>What's the problem this goal/target is trying to solve? Who's affected? Where in the world is this happening?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Lead students through a movement (and sound) brainstorm, asking leading questions such as:\n<ul>\n<li>What body shapes/actions show this struggle (e.g., hunched over for water scarcity, frantic scrubbing for pollution)</li>\n<li>Are there any literal gestures? (e.g., turning a faucet, washing hands)</li>\n</ul><br>If utilizing sound\n<ul>\n<li>What sounds represent this issue? (e.g., dripping for leaks, machinery for industrial pollution)</li>\n<li>Can voices by used? (e.g., whispers for lack of access, chants for protest)</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Guide groups to think about how the movement (and sound) can change to show progress towards the target.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

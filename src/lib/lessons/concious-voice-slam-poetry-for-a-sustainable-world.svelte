	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and performance to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 12 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to be smarter about the things we use and make. Emphasize that this means:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Being mindful:</em> Thinking about what we buy and if we really need it.</li>\n<li><em>Reducing waste:</em> Using less, and throwing away less.</li>\n<li><em>Reusing and recycling:</em> Finding new lives for old things.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`It’s about making things in a way that’s good for the planet and making sure we don’t use up all our planet’s resources, so there’s enough for a long time.<br>`\t`Introduce Slam Poetry. Explain that slam poetry is a type of poem that is meant to be performed out loud with a lot of energy and emotion. Clarify that it uses rhythm, repetition, and a powerful voice to make a point or tell a story. Tell students that slam poets often talk about what’s important to them, and today, they will all become slam poets, using their voices to talk about responsible consumption and production.<br>`\t`Show short excerpts from diverse slam poetry performances, focusing on:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Energy:</em> The energy and passion of the speaker.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythm:</em> The natural rhythm of the words and the use of repetition.</li>\n<li><em>Message:</em> The clear and powerful message being delivered.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DpE2zbH_Iw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Evolution”</a>, Solli Raphael</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLTG6GGEk1g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Beauty Queen”</a>, Rich Story</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ90OPnFNRY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“I am a Poem!”</a>, Saverio</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYaxQ2rVr9M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Poems are Like Our Soul”</a>, Joseph</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkll3qxK7Z4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Forest Fires”</a>, Sarah Kay</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOjHUC0Udo4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“My Honest Poem”</a>, Rudy Francisco</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RkIZ0P3U8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Buy Now or Panic Later”</a>, Aranya Johar ft Samuel</li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a brief discussion about the clips, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What did you notice about the poems? Did they rhyme or have a steady beat?</li>\n<li>How did the performers use their voices and bodies to make the poem more powerful?</li>\n<li>What do you think the main message of the poem was? How did they use rhythm and energy to make their message clear?</li>\n<li>What makes a slam poem so engaging and impactful? Why do you think a person would choose to perform a poem like that?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Sound and Object Poem"} content={"<p>**<br>`\t`Have the class form a circle.<br>Explain that the class will create a collaborative Sound and Object Poem, passing a simple object (e.g., a plastic bottle) around the circle. When a student receives the object, they will:\n<ul>\n<li>Make a sound that the object makes or that it reminds them of (e.g., a crinkling sound).</li>\n</ul><br>OR\n<ul>\n<li>Say a few very simple words that describe the object or its journey (e.g., Just a bottle).</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`They can then pass it to the next person.<br>`\t`Start the activity by modeling what this will look like, and handing the object off to the first student.<br>`\t`Example Sequence (water bottle as object):\n<ul>\n<li><em>Educator:</em> “crinkle crinkle” OR “Just a bottle” → <em>Student 1:</em> “whoosh” OR “Now it’s trash” → <em>Student 2:</em> “tap tap” OR “I can reuse it” → <em>Student 3:</em> “pop!” OR “A new flower pot”.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Guide the poem around the circle, encouraging quick thinking and simple, impactful words, communicating that there are no right or wrong answers.<br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming the creativity and connection between sound, objects, and storytelling.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"The Life of a Thing Storyboard"} content={"<p>`\t`Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z1ecQlgBiLeQOd5a-qnAvi-85XObnwbj/view?usp=drive_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Life of a Thing storyboard worksheet</a>, or have groups fold a piece of paper so there are three distinct sections.<br>`\t`<em>The Beginning (Production/Use)</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct groups to write a few words in the first rectangle about an object being produced or used for the first time.</li>\n<li>E.g. a factory making a plastic bottle, a person using a pen, a family eating a meal out of a takeout box.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Middle (The End of It’s Life)</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct groups to write about what happens when that object is finished being used, in the second rectangle. This is where the problem or challenge of waste happens.</li>\n<li>E.g. the bottle is thrown in the trash, the takeout box is left on the street, the pen is out of ink.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The End (The Solution/Hope)</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct groups to write, in the third rectangle how that object can get a second life or can be used in a responsible way. This is where a solution can happen.</li>\n<li>E.g., the bottle is put in a recycling bin, the takeout box is compostd and helps a garden grow, the pen is cut up and used for a craft project.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Encourage groups to brainstorm keywords and feelings for each panel (e.g., happy, sad, busy, clean, wasteful, smart, etc.). They can write them in each square if desired to help remember these keywords for later.<br>`\t`Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What sound would you hear in the factory part?</li>\n<li>What feeling would you have in the trash part?</li>\n<li>What action shows a solution in the last part?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Our Consumption Chants"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that each group will now create a short, collective slam poem or chant (about 30-60 seconds long) based on their storyboard. Ensure students know their poem should use rhythm, repetition, and a powerful voice to tell the story, from a problem to a solution.<br>`\t`Instruct groups to:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Identify the Voices:</em> Decide who will speak for the problem part of the story, and who will speak for the solution part. They can have one person be a narrator if wanted, and others be the voices of an object, the factory, or the community. More than one person can also speak at the same time.</li>\n<li><em>Focus on Rhythm and Repetition:</em> Slam poems use a beat. Students can use snaps, claps, or stomps to create beats for their poem. They can use repeated words or phrases to make the message strong and memorable.</li>\n<li><em>Show the Story:</em> Have students make sure their poem clearly moves from showing the before/problem to the after/solution from their storyboard.</li>\n<li><em>Use their Voices:</em> Encourage students to use loud/soft voices, fast/slow speeds, and emotional tones to make the performance powerful.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Provide prompts for inspiration, if needed.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>A plastic bottle, so shiny and new / A plastic bottle, I used you</li>\n<li>I see a mountain of trash, so tall / I see a mountain of trash, so tall / I pick up a can, and I start a new call / Reduce, reuse, recycle for all</li>\n<li>The factory goes bump-bump-bump / bump-bump-bump / The factory goes bump-bump-bump / bump-bump-bump / The factory is dirty, and it’s a big dump / We need a new idea, and we need it to jump</li>\n<li>The lunchbox is full, the lunchbox is full / I eat my good food, and I pull / the orange peel out / to compost it now / for a beautiful plant, and I give a big shout</li>\n</ul><br>Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can you use a loud voice to show the problem?</li>\n<li>What words can you repeat to make your poem stronger?</li>\n<li>What beat will you use to make your poem exciting?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Performance Showcase and Discussion"} content={"<p>Explain that each group will perform their collaborative slam poem. Encourage them to use their voices, bodies, and rhythm to make the message as powerful as possible.<br>After each performance, facilitate a brief discussion, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What story did you hear in their poem?</li>\n<li>How did they use rhythm or repetition to make the message stand out?</li>\n<li>What was the most powerful message or line in their poem about being responsible with what we use?</li>\n<li>What did their performance make you feel about Global Goal 12?</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude the discussion by affirming their creativity and powerful voices.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did the collaborative process of writing and performing a slam poem help you explore the complexities of responsible consumption and production?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of rhythm, rhyme, and performance in slam poetry to communicate urgent messages about sustainability?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns through this poetic exploration?</li>\n<li>How can giving a voice to environmental issues through a performance like this contribute to a broader social change?</li>\n<li>What is one key takeaway about responsible consumption and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, collaborative writing, rehearsal, and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concepts of responsible consumption and production (reducing waste, reusing, recycling), as demonstrated through the thematic content and message of the slam poem/chant and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in crafting the collaborative slam poem/chant. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 12 (does the poem clearly tell a story about a consumption problem and solution?), use of elements (are there attempts to use rhythm, repetition, and a powerful voice to convey the message?), and story structure (does the poem have a clear beginning/problem and end/solution?).</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the groups, contributing ideas, and collaborating cohesively to write and perform the poem.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with a clear and engaging explanation of UN Global Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Emphasize the urgency and the climate crisis and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Briefly review any key targets and indicators wanted (can highlight Target 13.1 - strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters).<br>Introduce the story of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria Breifly explain the devastating impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico in 2017.\n<ul>\n<li>Start with a Global Connection:</li>\n<li>Before we begin our musical exploration, we are going to talk about a real-world example of the devastating effects of climate change. We’re going to focus on the story of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.</li>\n<li>Remember that Global Goal 13 is about taking urgent action on climate change. What happened in Puerto Rico shows us why that action is so important.</li>\n<li>Provide Geographic Background:</li>\n<li>Puerto Rico is an island in the Caribbean Sea. It’s a US territory with a rich culture and history.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.twinkl.com/resource/puerto-rico-on-the-map-of-north-america-display-poster-t-g-1727193235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">REFERENCE MAP</a></li>\n<li>Introduce Hurricane Maria</li>\n<li>In September 2017, Puerto Rico was struck by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm with incredibly strong winds and torrential rain.</li>\n<li>It was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.</li>\n<li>Depicting the Destruction</li>\n<li>Show visual evidence. Examples:</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-before-after.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Before and After, The New York Times</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://time.com/a-land-they-no-longer-recognize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/09/world/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-cnnphotos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Images: Hurricane Maria, CNN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDk-EjjaMSk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View massive damage across Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria in this drone footage</a></li>\n<li>Focus on:</li>\n<li><em>Widespread flooding:</em> Notice how entire towns are underwater. This is what happens when we have increased rainfall and storm surges.</li>\n<li><em>Damaged Infrastructure:</em> Look at the roads washed away, the buildings destroyed, the power lines down. This is the vulnerability of our infrastructure.</li>\n<li><em>Impact on homes and communities:</em> See the homes ripped apart, the families displaced. Imagine what it would be like to lose everything.</li>\n<li><em>Environmental damage:</em> Notice ay damaged forests or coastlines. Hurricanes can have a huge impact on ecosystems.</li>\n<li>Narrate with empathy:</li>\n<li>As you see these photos/videos, think about the poeple who lived through this. Think about their fear, their loss, their struggle.</li>\n<li><em>Use descriptive language to amplify the impact for students:</em> Imagine the roar of the wind, the relentless rain, the darkness when the power went out.</li>\n<li>Emphasize the challenges.</li>\n<li>Highlight the long term impact. The storm itself was terrible, but the aftermath was even more challenging. Focus on:</li>\n<li><em>Power outages:</em> For months, much of the island was without electricity. This affected hospitals, schools, businesses, and people’s daily lives.</li>\n<li><em>Limited resources:</em> Access to clean water, food, and medical care was severly limited. This created a humanitarian crisis.</li>\n<li><em>Communication breakdown:</em> It was difficult to communicate with the outside world, making it hard to get help.</li>\n<li><em>Displacement:</em> Many people lost their homes and had to relocate, either temporarily or permanently.</li>\n<li>Connect to broader issues. What happened in Puerto Rico is a stark reminder of the vulnerability of many communities to climate-related disasters.</li>\n<li>It also highlights issues of inequality, as marginalized communities often suffer the most.</li>\n<li>Highlight the connection to climate change: While hurricanes are natural events, climate change is making them more intense and frequent.</li>\n<li>Scientists have observed that warmer ocean temperatures, which are a result of climate change, fuel stronger hurricanes.</li>\n<li>Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise, which increases the risk of flooding from storm surges.</li>\n<li>We can’t say that climate change caused Hurricane Maria directly. But we can say that it made it more likely to be a powerful and devastating storm.</li>\n<li>Connect to Global Goal 13</li>\n<li>This devastation shows us the importance of Target 13.1, which is about strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity.</li>\n<li>We need to build stronger infrastructure, develop better disaster preparedness plans, and help communities recover.</li>\n</ul><br>Connect music and Puerto Rico’s story by facilitating a class discussion:\n<ul>\n<li>What sounds come to mind when you think of a hurricane? (e.g., wind, rain, crashing waves)</li>\n<li>What sounds might represent the aftermath of a disaster? (e.g., silence, rubble, rebuilding)</li>\n<li>What kind of music might express the resilience and spirit of the Puerto Rican people? (e.g., traditional Puerto Rican music)</li>\n<li>How can we use rhythm and percussion to tell the story of Hurricane Maria and the community’s response?</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce basic rhythm patterns.<br>Explain that rhythm is the organization of sounds in time.<br>Introduce simple rhythmic concepts using body percussion (clapping, snapping, stomping):\n<ul>\n<li><em>Beat</em>: The steady pulse of the music.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythm:</em> Patterns of short and long sounds.</li>\n<li><em>Repetition:</em> Repeating a rhythmic pattern.</li>\n</ul><br>Demonstrate simple rhythmic patterns and have students repeat them.<br>Example:\n<ul>\n<li>Clap on beats 1 and 3: “CLAP - 2 - CLAP - 4”</li>\n<li>Snap on beats 2 and 4 “1 - SNAP - 3 - SNAP”</li>\n</ul><br>Explain that different rhythms can represent different aspects of Puerto Rico’s story.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Guided Rhythmic Exploration: Puerto Rico’s Story"} content={"<p>Guide the entire class through a rhythmic exploration of Puerto Rico’s story, using call and response and guided creation of rhythms.<br>Example:\n<ul>\n<li>Let’s start by creating the sound of the hurricane. Imagine the wind building up. Can you create a rhythm that sounds like the wind?</li>\n<li>(Demonstrate a simple, repetitive rhythm on a drum/shaker/etc., gradually increasing in volume and speed.)</li>\n<li>I’ll play the wind, you play the rain. (Call and response)</li>\n<li>(Play a “wind” rhythm, students create “rain” sounds with shakers or tapping on percussion instruments, snapping, etc.)</li>\n<li>Now, let’s add the sound of crashing waves.</li>\n<li>(Play a “wind” and “rain” rhythm, students add crashing sounds with drums, buckets, etc.)</li>\n<li>After the hurricane, there was a moment of silence. How can we show that in our music?</li>\n<li>(Lead a section of silence, punctuated by occasional quiet sounds of “debris falling” or a “siren.”)</li>\n<li>I’ll play the silence, you play the echoes. (Call and response)</li>\n<li>(Play a slow, sparse rhythm, students add occasional quiet sounds.)</li>\n<li>The people of Puerto Rico needed help. How can we show their urgent need?</li>\n<li>(Lead a repetitive, insistent rhythm, gradually increasing in volume and intensity.)</li>\n<li>I’ll play the need, you play the helping hands (Call and response).</li>\n<li>(Play the urgent rhythm, students add supportive rhythms that build in strength and complexity.)</li>\n<li>But even in the face of disaster, the community came together. How can we show their strength and unity?</li>\n<li>(Lead a rhythm with a strong, steady beat and call-and-response elements, representing the community working together.)</li>\n<li>I’ll play the heartbeat, you play the voices (Call and response).</li>\n<li>(Play a steady heartbeat rhythm, students add rhythmic shouts or chants, ex. “Fuerza Puerto Rico!”)</li>\n<li>Finally, let’s create the sound of rebuilding. What rhythms would we hear?</li>\n<li>(Lead rhythms that mimic hammering, sawing and other construction sounds, gradually building in complexity and energy.)</li>\n<li>I’ll play the tools, you play the hope (Call and response).</li>\n<li>Play teh construction rhythms, students add rhythms that express hope and determination.</li>\n</ul><br>Throughout this section:\n<ul>\n<li>Provide clear instructions and demonstrations.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to experiment and be creative.</li>\n<li>Connect the rhythms to the specific emotions and events of Puerto Rico’s story.</li>\n<li>Use call and response to engage all students and build a sense of collective creation</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Whole-Class Rhythmic Performance"} content={"<p>Guide the class in combining the different rhythmic sections to create a complete musical narrative of Puerto Rico’s experience.<br>Remember to:\n<ul>\n<li>Direct the transitions between the sections.</li>\n<li>Control the dynamics (loudness/softness) and tempo (speed).</li>\n<li>Encourage students to listen carefully to each other and blend their sounds.</li>\n</ul><br>Optional: Incorporate optional recordings of hurricaine sounds or Puerto Rican music to enhance the performance.<br>Create a powerful and moving musical moment that tells the story of Hurricane Maria and the resilience of the Puerto Rican people.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection and Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion and writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did creating rhythms and sounds for the different phases of Hurricane Maria’s impact and Puerto Rico’s recovery help you connect with the story on a deeper, more emotional level?</li>\n<li>What sensations or feelings did you experience in your body as you played rhythms representing the hurricaine’s fury, the aftermath, or the rebuilding efforts?</li>\n<li>Did the act of collectively creating a musical narrative change your understanding of the resilience and strength of the Puerto Rican people?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of sound and rhythm to convey emotions like chaos, loss, hope, and unity, without needing words?</li>\n<li>How did connecting your individual contributions to the larger “story” of the class’s musical piece reflect the interconnectedness of communities in times of crisis?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 13 and the devastating impacts of climate change on communities like Puerto Rico through this rhythmic activity?</li>\n<li>How did mapping the phases of a disaster and recovery musically help you understand the importance of resilience and adaptation (Target 13.1) in the face of climate hazards?</li>\n<li>What connections did you make between the musical portrayal of challenges (like power outages or limited resources) and the broader issues of climate justice?</li>\n<li>How does the story of Puerto Rico, as told through our percussion, highlight the urgency of global climate action?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about how communities, even in vulnerable situations, mobilize their own strength and unity when facing climate disasters?</li>\n<li>Did any specific rhythms or moment in our musical narrative resonate with you personally, perhaps sparking a stronger sense of empathy or a call to action?</li>\n<li>What emotions did you connect with during this lesson, and how might those emotions motivate you to support climate action and disaster relief?</li>\n<li>What is one key takeaway about climate resilience and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?</li>\n<li>How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in advocating for a more sustainable and just future for all communities?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

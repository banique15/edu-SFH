	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by asking, “How do you express your emotions when words aren’t enough?”<br>Lead a brief discussion about how art, particularly expressionism, can be a powerful outlet for feelings and ideas. Examples of questions:\n<ul>\n<li>Think of a time you were really happy, or really upset, but struggled to find the right words to say how you felt. What did you do instead? Maybe you listened to music, wrote in a journal, or even just went for a run. Today, we’re going to explore how art can be a powerful way to express emotions that are hard to put into words or talk about.</li>\n</ul><br>Ask students for examples of how they express themselves without words. Expect things like:\n<ul>\n<li>Music choices</li>\n<li>Body language/facial expressions</li>\n<li>Doodles or drawings</li>\n<li>Fashion choices</li>\n<li>Actions (slamming a door, daydreaming, etc.)</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce and explain Expressionism, “Artists have been doing this for centuries. There’s a whole movement called Expressionism where the goal is to show strong emotions directly, not just paint a pretty picture. Think bold colors, distorted shapes, anything that makes you feel something when you look at it.”<br>Re-introduce Global Goal 5 (if necessary), “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”<br>Explain how Expressionist art, with its focus on raw emotion and subjective experience, can help us understand and communicate with complexities of gender inequality.\n<ul>\n<li>“Imagine you’re feeling frustrated beacuase you’re treated differently just because of your gender. Maybe you’re told you can’t do something, or you see someone else being treated unfairly. How would you paint that feeling/ Would it be bright and cheerful, or something else?”</li>\n</ul><br>Key points about Expressionism\n<ul>\n<li><em>Not about being \"good\" at drawing/painting</em>: It's about what the art <em>communicates</em>. A simple scribble can be powerful if it captures the emotion.</li>\n<li><em>Subjectivity is key</em>: There's no one \"right\" way to express anger, joy, etc. Each artist (and each of you) will do it differently. This mirrors the diverse experiences of gender inequality.</li>\n<li><em>Breaking the Mold</em>: Expressionism often breaks the rules of traditional art. This can represent breaking free from societal expectations and norms, just like fighting for gender equality.</li>\n</ul><br>Show examples of Expressionist artworks:<br><a href=\"https://www.kollwitz.de/en/woman-with-dead-child-kn-81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woman with Dead Child</a>, Käthe Kollwitz<br>This heart-wrenching image conveys the grief and despair of a mother who has lost her child, potentially due to lack of access to healthcare, a consequence of gender inequality.<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street,_Berlin_<br>(Kirchner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Street, Berlin</a>), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner<br>This bustling street scene, with its angular figures and jarring colors, can represent the feeling of being marginalized or objectified, a common experience for women in many societies.<br><a href=\"https://onlinecollection.leopoldmuseum.org/en/object/651-mother-and-child/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mother and Child</a>, Egon Schiele<br>This painting depicts a mother and child in a tender embrace, but the distorted figures and somber colors also suggest vulnerability and the challenges faced by mothers, particularly in contexts where maternal health care is inadequate.<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Scream</a>, Edvard Munch<br>While not explicitly about gender, the raw emotion and anxiety conveyed in this iconic painting can resonate with anyone who has felt silenced or oppressed, linking it to the fight against gender-based discrimination.<br><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/marianne-von-werefkin/me8ezlkayfe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twins</a>, Marianee von Werefkin<br>While the women appear somewhat melancholic, they also exude a quiet strength and dignity. This can symbolize the resilience of women in the face of discrimination and inequality, and their ability to find power and connection even in challenging circumstances.<br><a href=\"https://useum.org/artwork/Mad-Woman-Chaim-Soutine-1920\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Mad Woman</a>, Chaim Soutine<br>This piece could prompt a discussion on the historical and ongoing mistreatment of women's mental health. The woman's exaggerated expression and contorted posture may represent the societal dismissal and misunderstanding of women's emotional and psychological experiences. This can lead to conversations about breaking stigma, advocating for accessible mental health care, and empowering women to take control of their well-being, all crucial steps towards achieving gender equality.</p>"} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 13, Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 13 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to work together to protect our planet. Emphasize that this means:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fighting climate change:</em> Working to keep the Earth healthy and safe.</li>\n<li><em>Finding solutions:</em> Creating new and smart ways to power our world and live our lives.</li>\n<li><em>Protecting our communities:</em> Making sure our towns and cities are strong enough to handle big storms and other weather challenges.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Introduce Latin dance as a powerful art form that is celebrated around the world. Clarify that Latin dance is energetic, joyful, and is often done in groups, which helps build a sense of community. Explain that the class will use the rhythm, energy, and community of Latin dance to tell stories about climate change and how we can find solutions together.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: The Rhythm of Resilience"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the students will explore how music and movement can express two different feelings: chaos and resilience.<br>`\t`Play Latin music of your choice, that will fit well with the below activity.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ho86ggAVrY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Vida Es Un Carnaval</a>” Celia Cruz</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiEbYSF9kE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Suavemente</a>” Elvis Crespo</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Chaos Rhythm:</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to move their bodies in a way that expresses a feeling of chaos.</li>\n<li>While students are moving, prompt and ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>This is what it might feel like when a big storm or disaster hits our community.</li>\n<li>What does that look like in your body?</li>\n<li>Is it a jerky movement?</li>\n<li>Is it a shaking movement?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Resilience Rhythm</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Then instruct students to transition their movements from chaos to resilience.</li>\n<li>While students are moving, prompt and ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>This is what it feels like when our community comes together to rebuild and support each other.</li>\n<li>What does that look like in your body?</li>\n<li>Is it a strong movement?</li>\n<li>Is it a grounded movement?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Transition</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to transition between the two rhythms, moving from a feeling of chaos to a feeling of resilience. This transition will help prepare them for the emotional storytelling of the main activity.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming the expressive abilities and transitions, explaining that they will use these contrasting feelings to tell stories about climate action.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Climate Story Movement Brainstorm"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the students will create a Climate Story Movement brainstorm to get their minds and bodies thinking about how to represent Global Goal 13 in dance and movement.<br>`\t`Instruct students to find a comfortable space and think about the following two ideas, creating a simple, individual post or gesture for each one.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Pose 1, A Climate Challenge</em></li>\n<li>Ask students to think of one climate challenge they’ve heard about or experienced. Then, ask them to think about a simple pose or gesture that they could use to show that challenge.</li>\n<li>Give students a few moments to think about their climate challenge and movement.</li>\n<li><em>Post 2, A Climate Solution</em></li>\n<li>Now, ask students to think of one way the we can take action to help the planet. This can be specific to their challenge or a larger, holistic action. Ask them to think about a simple, strong post or gesture that shows that solution.</li>\n<li>Give students a few moments to think about their climate solution and movement.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Have students quickly and quietly perform their two poses, first the challenge and then the solution.<br>`\t`Have a few students share their poses with the class. This will begin to give students a movement vocabulary and connect their own ideas to Global Goal 13.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Choreography and Rehearsal"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the class will now learn a series of simple Latin dance steps that, when put together, will tell a story about climate change.

	<Introduction content={"<p>Start by explaining what farce is to students.<br><em> </em>Simple Definition:<em> Farce is like comedy on steroids. It’s over-the-top, silly, and often involves ridiculous situations, physical humor, and misunderstandings.<br></em> <em>Relatable Examples:</em> Think of those times when everything seems to go wrong in the most hilarious way, or when a small misunderstanding snowballs into a complete disaster. That’s the essence of farce.<br><em> </em>Purpose:<em> We use farce in theater and comedy to make people laugh and to highlight the absurdity of certain situations. Today, we’ll use it to shed light on the challenges in education globally, but in a way that is fun and engaging.<br>Examples of farce:<br></em> Monty Python and the Holy Grail, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The “Black Knight” scene</a><br><em> Key and Peele, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE09D_qfFUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Substitute Teacher</a> (clean version)<br></em> Peter Pan Goes Wrong, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL0s8nH04gY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Give me the Sworrrd</a><br><em> The Simpsons, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89V_BGnMkgM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sideshow Bob Compilation</a><br>Students brainstorm ridiculous school scenarios, like:<br></em> The principal is a chicken, and the school rule is “no clucking in class”.<br><em> All textbooks are written in gibberish, and the students must pretend to understand.<br></em> The cafeteria only serves slime, but everyone pretends it’s delicious.<br>In pairs, students act out these scenarios with over-the-top emotions and physcial comedy. This gets them warmed up to the farcical style and breaks down inhibitions.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Farcical Skits: Exaggerating the Challenges"} content={"<p>Divide the students into groups, assigning each a Global Goal 4 Target.<br>Provide prompts that exaggerate existing educational challenges to highlight their absurdity.<br>Examples<br><em> </em>4.1 \\- Quality Education<em>: A teacher is a robot with only one pre-programmed lesson, students revolt in boredom.<br></em> <em>4.2 \\- Early Childhood Development</em>: The only toy in the daycare is a single, giant ball of yarn that all the kids must fight over.<br><em> </em>4.3 \\- Access to Higher Ed<em>: A university admissions office only accepts students who can juggle flaming torches while reciting Shakespeare.<br></em> <em>4.4 \\- Skills for Employment</em>: The career counselor insists the only job in the future is \"professional cat video commentator.\"<br><em> </em>4.5 \\- Gender Equality<em>: A school has separate entrances for boys and girls, with wildly different facilities.<br></em> <em>4.6 \\- Literacy and Numeracy</em>: The math teacher only speaks in rhymes, and students must answer in limericks to get credit.<br><em> </em>4.7 \\- Education for Sustainable Development<em>: The school's recycling program is so intense, students must compost their own homework.<br></em> <em>4.a \\- Safe and Inclusive Schools</em>: The school's new \"safe space\" is an inflatable bouncy castle in the middle of the cafeteria, causing constant disruptions and accidental injuries as students bounce around during lunch.<br><em> </em>4.b \\- Scholarships<em>: The scholarship application requires contestants to build a fully functional spaceship out of recycled materials.<br></em> <em>4.c \\- Qualified Teachers</em>: The entire teaching staff is replaced by pigeons, and students must decipher their cooing to learn.<br>Groups create short skits based on their prompt, using farce techniques:<br><em> </em>Physical Comedy<em>: Slapstick, exaggerated movements, silly voices<br></em> <em>Misunderstandings</em>: Characters take things <em>very</em> literally, leading to absurd situations<br><em> </em>Repetition*: A running gag or phrase gets funnier each time</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Switching Gears: The “Serious Person” Scene"} content={"<p>Same groups, new prompt. Groups now improvise a scene where ONE character is the “serious person” \\- serious, while others remain farcical.<br>This contrasts the real-world impact amidst the silliness.<br>Examples:<br><em> </em>Target 4.1<em><br></em> <em>Prompt:</em> The class is in chaos. The robot teacher has malfunctioned, spouting nonsensical phrases and shooting lasers at random. One student, however, sits quietly at their desk, desperately trying to learn from a tattered textbook.<br><em> </em>Play Out:<em> The other students could engage in slapstick comedy, dodging lasers and mimicking the robot's nonsensical phrases. The \"serious person\" student could express frustration and sadness, highlighting the real-world impact of inadequate resources and ineffective teaching methods.<br></em> <em>Target 4.2</em><br><em> </em>Prompt:<em> The daycare is filled with toddlers engaging in a chaotic pillow fight, flinging feathers and giggling uncontrollably. One child sits alone in a corner, overwhelmed by the noise and unable to participate due to a developmental delay.<br></em> <em>Play Out:</em> The other children could continue their playful antics, while the \"serious person\" child could express their loneliness and isolation through subtle movements and facial expressions, drawing attention to the importance of inclusive early childhood care.<br><em> </em>Target 4.3<em><br></em> <em>Prompt:</em> The university admissions office is holding absurd tryouts, with applicants performing ridiculous stunts to gain admission. One applicant, however, stands apart, holding their academic achievements and pleading for a fair chance.<br><em> </em>Play Out:<em> The other applicants could engage in over-the-top physical comedy and exaggerated displays of talent. The \"serious person\" applicant could express their frustration and disappointment, highlighting the real-world barriers faced by those who can't afford or access traditional higher education pathways.<br></em> <em>Target 4.4</em><br><em> </em>Prompt:<em> A group of friends are enthusiastically role-playing as \"professional cat video commentators,\" complete with silly voices and exaggerated gestures. One friend, however, observes from the sidelines, worried about their lack of practical skills and job prospects.<br></em> <em>Play Out:</em> The friends could continue their playful commentary, while the \"serious person\" friend could express their anxiety and uncertainty about the future, highlighting the importance of acquiring relevant skills for employment.<br><em> </em>Target 4.5<em><br></em> <em>Prompt:</em> The school is holding a talent show, but boys and girls are segregated, performing vastly different acts based on gender stereotypes. One student, regardless of gender, challenges this division, advocating for equal opportunities and expression.<br><em> </em>Play Out:<em> The other students could perform exaggerated, stereotypical acts (e.g., boys flexing their muscles, girls performing ballet). The \"serious person\" student could deliver a passionate speech or perform a talent that defies expectations, highlighting the need to break down gender barriers in education.<br></em> <em>Target 4.6</em><br><em> </em>Prompt:<em> A group of adults is attending a literacy class, but the teacher insists on teaching through interpretive dance. One student, however, desperately tries to decipher the alphabet on the board, their frustration growing with each passing moment.<br></em> <em>Play Out:</em> The other students could enthusiastically follow the teacher's absurd instructions, while the \"serious person\" student could express their confusion and struggle, highlighting the real-world impact of illiteracy and the need for accessible adult education.<br><em> </em>Target 4.7<em><br></em> <em>Prompt:</em> The school is hosting an environmental awareness day, but the activities are all farcical and ineffective (e.g., students wearing costumes made of plastic bottles, singing nonsensical songs about recycling). One student, however, passionately advocates for real change and sustainable practices.<br><em> </em>Play Out:<em> The other students could participate in the silly activities with exaggerated enthusiasm. The \"serious person\" student could deliver a heartfelt speech or organize a meaningful project, highlighting the urgency of addressing environmental issues through education.<br></em> <em>Target 4.a</em><br><em> </em>Prompt:<em> The school has implemented a new \"zero-tolerance\" policy for any form of conflict, resulting in students being punished for even the slightest disagreement. Amidst the absurd punishments (e.g., detention in a giant hamster ball), one student bravely speaks out against the stifling of healthy debate and the importance of open communication.<br></em> <em>Play Out:</em> While other students are being rolled around in hamster balls for minor infractions, the \"serious person\" student could passionately argue for the importance of conflict resolution skills and open dialogue in a healthy school environment.<br><em> </em>Target 4.b<em><br></em> <em>Prompt:</em> While other students are being rolled around in hamster balls for minor infractions, the \"serious person\" student could passionately argue for the importance of conflict resolution skills and open dialogue in a healthy school environment.<br><em> </em>Play Out:<em> Amidst the ridiculous talent show, the \"serious person\" student could step forward and present their academic achievements, showcasing the value of hard work and dedication, while questioning the fairness of the scholarship selection process.<br></em> <em>Target 4.c</em><br><em> </em>Prompt:<em> The school has hired a new \"super-teacher\" who claims to have revolutionary teaching methods but only communicates through interpretive dance and puppet shows. The students are confused and disengaged, except for one dedicated student who tries to make sense of the chaos, emphasizing the importance of clear communication and effective teaching strategies.<br></em> <em>Play Out:</em> While the other students struggle to decipher the \"super-teacher's\" cryptic messages, the \"serious person\" student could express their frustration and advocate for the importance of clear communication and qualified educators who can provide effective instruction.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

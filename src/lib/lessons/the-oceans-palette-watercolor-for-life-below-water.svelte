	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with an engaging introduction to UN Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the importance of the oceans for life on Earth, their biodiversity, and the threats they face. If wanted, review any key targets and indicators.<br>Facilitate a class discussion:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some of your favorite things about the ocean?</li>\n<li>What are some of the biggest threats to marine life?</li>\n<li>How can art help us express our connection to the ocean and inspire action?</li>\n</ul><br>Explain that watercolor is a versatile medium that uses pigments suspended in water.<br>Demonstrate basic techniques (if needed):\n<ul>\n<li><em>Wet-on-wet:</em> Applying wet paint to wet paper for soft, blended effects.</li>\n<li><em>Wet-on-dry:</em> Applying wet paint to dry paper for sharper edges.</li>\n<li><em>Graded washes:</em> Creating smooth transitions from dark to light.</li>\n<li><em>Lifting:</em> Removing paint with a brush or sponge to create highlights.</li>\n<li><em>Layering:</em> Applying multiple washes of color to build depth.</li>\n</ul><br>Encourage students to experiment with these techniques on scrap paper.<br>Emphasize that watercolor is forgiving and encourages spontaneity.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Watercolor Exploration and Concept Development"} content={"<p>Guide the students in a watercolor exploration connected to Global Goal 14.<br>Use guided imagery and sketching.

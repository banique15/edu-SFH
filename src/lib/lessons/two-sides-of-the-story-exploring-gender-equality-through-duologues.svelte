	<Introduction content={"<em>   Divide the class into pairs.<br></em>   Explain “Today, we’re diving into Global Goal 5: Gender Equality. But first, let’s warm up our communication and empathy muscles.”<br><em>   Present the list of relatable topics, emphasizing that even seemingly simple issues can have multiple perspectives.<br></em>   Provide a list of relatable topics that resonate with teenagers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>School uniforms, pro vs. con</li>\n<li>Homework, necessary vs. unnecessary</li>\n<li>Cell phones in class, allowed vs. banned</li>\n<li>Social media, positive impact vs. negative impact</li>\n<li>Curfew, necessary for safety vs. restriction of freedom</li>\n<li>Climate change, individual responsibility vs. government action</li>\n</ul><br><em>   Have each pair randomly select, choose their own topic from the list, or assign their topics as is best for the class.<br></em>   Assign each student in the pair one of the opposing viewpoints.<br><em>   Encourage them to step into the shoes of someone who holds that view, even if it’s different from their own.<br></em>   Give them a few minutes to brainstorm arguments and consider the potential motivations and concerns of someone with that perspective.<br><em>   Initiate the dialoge, reminding students to:\n<ul>\n<li>Actively listen to their partner and try to understand their reasoning.</li>\n<li>Ask questions to clarify their partner’s perspective.</li>\n<li>Express their own viewpoint clearly and respectfully.</li>\n<li>Look for areas of common ground or potential compromise.</li>\n</ul><br></em>   Before students begin, ask them to think about how gender might influence someone’s opinion on their topic. Would it change the arguments they’d make or their priorities?<br><em>   Example dialogue prompts:\n<ul>\n<li></em>School Uniforms<em></li>\n<li>I believe school uniforms promote equality and reduce distractions.</li>\n<li>I think school uniforms stifle individuality and self-expression.</li>\n<li></em>Homework<em></li>\n<li>Homework helps us practice and understand what we’re learning.</li>\n<li>Homework is just extra work, and it takes away from the time we could spend learning other things</li>\n<li></em>Cell Phones<em></li>\n<li>Cell phones can be helpful for research and emergencies, as long as we use them responsibly.</li>\n<li>Cell phones are too tempting; they’ll just lead to us being off-task and not learning.</li>\n<li></em>Social Media<em></li>\n<li>Social media connects us with people all over the world and helps us stay informed.</li>\n<li>Social media can be addictive and lead to cyberbullying and unrealistic comparisons.</li>\n<li></em>Curfew<em></li>\n<li>Curfews protect us from danger at night when we’re more vulnerable.</li>\n<li>Curfews treat us like kids and stop us from having any independence.</li>\n<li></em>Climate Change<em></li>\n<li>Individual actions like recycling and reducing energy consumption are crucial for combating climate change.</li>\n<li>Government policies and regulations are necessary to address the systemic causes of climate change.</li>\n</ul><br></em>   Facilitate a whole-class discussion after the dialoges, asking questions such as:\n<ul>\n<li>How did it feel to argue for a viewpoint you might not personally agree with?</li>\n<li>What were some of the challenges or surprises you encountered during the conversation?</li>\n<li>Did you notice any assumptions about gender roles or expectations come up in your dialogues, even on topics not directly about gender?</li>\n<li>What strategies did you use to try to understand your partner’s perspective? (active listening, asking questions, paraphrasing, etc.)</li>\n<li>Did you find any common ground or areas of agreement, even though you started with opposing viewpoints?</li>\n<li>Just like in these debates, gender equality issues have multiple sides. How can the skills we practiced here (listening, questioning, etc.) help us have productive conversations about these complex topics?</li>\n<li>What are the potential consequences of not listening to and respecting diverse viewpoints?</li>\n</ul>"} />

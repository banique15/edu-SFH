	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting dance and movement class. Explain that they will explore a really important idea: Global Goal 7, Affordable and Clean Energy.<br>This goal focuses on making sure everyone, everywhere, has access to energy that is affordable (not too expensive), reliable (always there when you need it), and clean (good for the planet). Emphasize that this means lights for homes and schools, clean ways to cook food, and power for our devices, all without harming the Earth.<br>Explain that just as dance needs energy to make our bodies move, our world needs energy to make everything work. Introduce the style and game of Freeze Dance.<br>Explain the rules clearly:<br><em> When the music plays, students can dance and move freely, expressing themselves however they like.<br></em> When the music stops, everyone must freeze in place immediately, holding their pose completely still.<br><em> Clarify that any movement after the music stops (even a wiggle) means they might be out of that round. NOTE: Choose the level of competition for your students and class that is appropriate.<br>Have students think about the connection to Global Goal 7 while they are moving and dancing. The exciting, continuous movements represent the flow of energy that powers our world, especially clean energy.<br>The sudden freezes are moments like energy challenges, solutions, etc. Emphasize that the creativity in their dance moves and freeze poses should mirror the innovative solutions needed to bring clean energy to everyone.<br>Examples of upbeat, energetic, and empowering music with clear changes in tempo and dynamics, suitable for freeze dance and to use throughout the lesson:<br></em> Energy, The Apples in Stereo<br><em> Here Comes the Sun, The Beatles<br></em> Walking On Sunshine, Katrine &amp; The Waves<br><em> Windy, The Association<br></em> The Wind Cries Mary, Jimi Hendrix<br><em> Wind of Change, Scorpions<br></em> Blowin’ in the Wind, Bob Dylan<br><em> Wichita Lineman, Glen Campbell<br></em> It’s Electric, Metallica<br><em> Electric Car, They Might Be Giants<br></em> The Wind, Yusuf/Cat Stevens<br><em> Ride Like The Wind, Christopher Cross<br></em> Sixteen Tons, Tennessee Ernie Ford<br><em> Working in the Coal Mine, DEVO<br></em> Electric Slide, Electric Slide Music Makers<br><em> Electric Youth, Debbie Gibson<br></em> Soak Up The Sun, Sharyl Crow<br><em> Who Loves the Sun, The Velvet Underground<br></em> Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Elton John<br><em> California Sun, Ramones<br></em> Sunshine On My Shoulder, John Denver<br><em> The House of the Rising Sun, Nina Simone<br></em> Sheer Energy, Sly &amp; The Family Stone<br><em> High Voltage, AC/DC<br></em> The Power, SNAP\\!<br><em> Energy, Buzzcocks<br></em> Artificial Energy, The Byrds<br><em> Turn off the Lights, Teddy Pendergrass<br></em> Lights, Journey<br><em> Make a Circuit With Me, The Polecats<br></em> Walkin’ On The Sun, Smash Mouth<br><em> Sun Is Shining, Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers<br></em> Invisible Sun, The Police<br><em> Let The Sunshine In (Reprise), The 5th Dimension<br></em> I’ll Follow the Sun, The Beatles<br><em> Sunglasses at Night, Corey Hart<br></em> Solar Power, Lorde<br><em> The Electric Co., U2<br></em> Turn Your Lights Down Low, Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up"} content={"<em>Individual Pulse</em><br><em> Say: Gently tap your finger on your leg. Find a rhythm that feels like your own inner energy pulse (maybe fast, maybe slow, maybe steady). This is your energy.<br></em> Guide students to find and mainstain a personal rhythm.<br><em>Group Pulse</em><br><em> Say: Now, keep your individual pulse going, but listen to the pulses of the people around you. Can you adjust your pulse slightly to match the pulse of your neighbor, or to find a shared group pulse?<br></em> Encourage students to listen and subtly synchronize.<br><em>Amplify and Freeze</em><br><em> Say: As a whole group, let’s make our shared pulse get bigger and stronger, a powerful energy pulse for our class.<br></em> Guide the class to collectively amplify their rhythm and sound, perhaps adding foot taps or claps)<br><em> Unexpectedly stop the pulse by yelling “FREEZE”<br></em> Instruct the students to hold their current body and facial expressions completely still.<br><em>Restart and Repeat</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Restart the pulse, having students begin to move with it again. Repeat Amplify and Freeze a few times, getting students used to the immediate freeze.</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude the warm up by affirming the responsiveness and shared energy."} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Energy Icon Freeze"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will now play freeze dance, and during the freezes, you will call out different energy themes. Students will create a pose or statue that represents that theme when they freeze.<br><em>Round 1: Getting Started</em><br><em> Play music and instruct students to dance freely. When the music stops, call out “FREEZE.” Then call out a prompt, and students must quickly adapt their pose.<br>Prompt Examples<br></em> <em>Power Up:</em> Freeze like you’re full of energy, ready to go\\! (e.g., strong powerful post, flexing, bright face, reaching up).<br><em> </em>Lights On:<em> Freeze like a light bulb just turned on, bright and happy\\! (e.g., open, expansive post, smiling, reaching arms out like rays).<br></em> <em>Charging Up:</em> Freeze like a device getting all its energy back\\! (e.g., curled up, slowly opening, receiving energy, focused face).<br>Restart the music and continue.<br><em>Round 2: Energy Source</em><br><em> During the next few freezes, call out different clean energy sources. Students create a pose for each.<br>Prompt Examples:<br></em> <em>Solar Power:</em> Freeze like a solar panel soaking up the sun’s rays\\! (e.g., flat hand facing up, body wide, open, looking up, absorbing).<br><em> </em>Wind Power:<em> Freeze like a giant wind turbine spinning in the breeze\\! (e.g., one arm out like a blade, body slightly twisted, spinning subtly, balanced).<br></em> <em>Water Power:</em> Freeze like strong, flowing water in a river or a powerful waterfall\\! (e.g., fluid, wavy arms, body in a strong flowing line, dynamic pose).<br>Restart the music and continue.<br><em>Round 3: Energy Challenges and Solutions:</em><br><em> During the next freezes, call out a problem or a way to save energy.<br>Prompt Examples:<br></em> <em>No Lights:</em> Freeze like you’re trying to see in the dark, or feeling sad because it’s dark\\! (e.g., squinting eyes, hands cupped around eyes, hunched, small worried expression).<br><em> </em>Saving Energy:<em> Freeze in a pose that shows you’re being super energy efficient\\! (e.g., crouched low, body tightly held, arms crossed, miming turning off a light switch, being small/compact).<br></em> <em>Clean Air:</em> Freeze like you’re breathing in fresh, clean air, feeling healthy\\! (e.g., deep breath in, chest open, arms wide, smiling, standing tall).<br>Open a brief discussion after these initial rounds. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> Which energy ideas were easiest to show with your body? Which were tricky?<br></em> What did you notice about how your classmates showed solar power or no lights?\n<ul>\n<li>How does showing these energy ideas with our bodies help us understand them?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Energy Transformation Freeze Dance Challenge"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups (3-5 students). Each group will choose one energy transformation story to choreograph and perform using freeze dance.<br>Present the transformation story options:<br><em> </em>Option 1: Darkness to Light:<em> Show a scene where there’s no power, then transform to a scene with bright, clean energy. (e.g., no electricity → solar lamp provides light).<br></em> <em>Option 2: Pollution to Clean:</em> Show a scene with smoky air or dirty water from old energy, then transform to a scene with clear, fresh air or water from clean energy. (e.g., smoky factory → clean wind turbine provides power).<br><em> </em>Option 3: Waste to Smart Use:<em> Show a scene of energy waste, then transform to a scene of energy efficiency or smart use. (e.g., lights left on → turning off lights/unplugging).<br></em> <em>Option 4: Slow to Powerful:</em> Show a slow, weak energy source, then transform to a powerful, strong clean energy source. (e.g., small drip of water → strong hydropower).<br>Instruct each group to create a short dance sequence (approximately 45-60 seconds) that visually represents their chosen transformation. The choreography should clearly show the “before” state, the “transformation” (change) in the middle, and the “after” state.<br>Emphasize the Freeze Dance twist:<br><em> The music will play continuously as groups perform their sequences.<br></em> The music will be paused twice during each group’s performance, at unknown times. Groups must freeze instantly in a pose that captures a key moment in their energy transformation (e.g., a “darkness” post, a “struggle” post, a “power-up” pose, etc.).<br>Provide simple choreography prompts to guide their creation.<br>Examples:<br><em> </em>Darkness to Light:<em> Start with small, huddled movements for darkness. Build to reaching and stretching movements for finding light. End with expansive, joyful poses for bright energy.<br></em> <em>Pollution to Clean:</em> Begin with sluggish, constricted movements for pollution. Show active, clearing or cleaning motions in the middle. End with light, airy, free movements for clean environment.<br><em> </em>Waste to Smart Use:<em> Start with uncontrolled, sprawling movements for waste. Shift to careful, precise, or compact movements for efficiency. End with a strong, balanced pose for smart use.<br></em> <em>Slow to Powerful:</em> Begin with gentle, repetitive movements for low energy. Build gradually to strong, fast, and unified motions for powerful energy. End with a pose of immense strength or the group showing the power of a turbine/dam together.<br>Circulate, encouraging teamwork, problem solving, and creative expression. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> How does your dance show the before part of your energy story?<br></em> What freeze pose would campture the moment the energy becomes clean?\n<ul>\n<li>Are you thinking about the flow from one part of your story to the next?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Performances: Energy Transformation Showcase"} content={"<p>Gather the class and explain that each group will perform their dance. You will control the music, pausing it twice during each performance, so they should be ready\\!<br>Instruct the audience to observe closely to understand the connection between the choreography, energy transformation, and freeze poses depicted.<br>After each performance, facilitate a brief discussion where the groups discuss their creative choices and students share their observations.<br>Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> What energy transformation story did you see in their dance (e.g., Darkness to Light, Pollution to Clean, etc.)?<br></em> Which specific movements or freeze poses helped you understand the before, middle, and/or after of their story?<br><em> What message or feeling about energy did their dance make you have?<br></em> What was challenging or exciting about creating your dance? How did your group work together?</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<ReflectionQuestions questions={["How did dancing, and especially freezing, help you understand Global Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy in a new way?","What did you learn about how energy transforms, from old ways to new, or from challenges to solutions?","Which dances or freeze poses from your classmates made you think or feel the most about energy, and why?","What does this lesson tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 7?","What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to save energy or promote clean energy, perhaps because you feel more energized by our dances?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<AssessmentCriteria criteria={["Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, group dance creation, and class discussions.","Understanding of the core concept of affordable and clean energy (sources, challenges, efficiency, solutions, transformation), as demonstrated through the dance movements, freeze poses, and verbal explanations.","Originality and effectiveness in designing a short dance sequence that visually represents the chosen energy transformation story. Look for clear portrayal of the before and after states through movement, impactful and well-held freeze poses at key moments, and creative use of movement qualities to show energy (e.g., power, flow, efficiency, transformation).","Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse approaches, and collaborating cohesively to choreograph and perform the dance. This also includes responsiveness to the freeze cues as a whole class.","Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion."]} {sdgColor} />

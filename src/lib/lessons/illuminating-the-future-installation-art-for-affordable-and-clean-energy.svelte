	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by showing videos of impactful environmental issues related to energy production and consumption.<br>Examples:<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2014/10/14/ending-energy-poverty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ending Energy Poverty</a>, World Bank Group<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xraThzKoXU8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Energy Poverty</a>, Bill Gates<br>Re-introduce Global Goal 7, if necessary: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.<br>Open a discussion connecting to students’ lives, by asking questions like:<br><em> Can you imagine your life without reliable access to electricity or clean cooking fuels?<br></em> What kind of impact do you think these problems have on people’s health, the environment, and our future?<br><em> Think about a typical day in your life. How do you use energy from the moment you wake up to the time you go to bed?<br></em> What are some energy sources that power your home, school, and community?<br><em> Have you ever experienced a power outage? How did it affect your daily routine?<br></em> Have you noticed any changes in the environment around you that you think might be related to energy production or use?<br><em> Do you know anyone who struggles to afford their energy bills or doesn’t have access to reliable energy sources?<br>Briefly explain the concept of installation art, highlighting its immersive and transformative nature. Show examples of installation art that addresses energy themes.<br></em> <a href=\"https://publicdelivery.org/luzinterruptus-waste-labyrinth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Waste Labyrinth</a>, Luzinterruptus<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/artists/this-magic-moment-ugo-rondinone-places-seven-mountains-in-the-desert-outside-las-vegas-6438/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seven Magic Mountains</a>, Ugo Rondinone<br></em> <a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/artwork/the-weather-project-2003/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Weather Project</a>, Olafur Eliasson<br><em> <a href=\"https://mymodernmet.com/daniel-popper-siemens-boabab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Siemens Boabab Tree</a>, Daniel Popper<br></em> Imagine walking into an art exhibit, but instead of just looking at paintings on a wall, you’re surrounded by the art itself. You can walk through it, touch it, maybe even interact with it. That’s what installation art is all about \\- creating an immersive experience that makes you think and feel differently about the world around you. It’s like stepping into another reality, one that the artist has created to convey a message or evoke emotions.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Goal and Target Exploration and Brainstorming"} content={"<p>Divide the class into groups, assigning each group a goal or target. Provide each group with a simplified explanation.<br>Encourage groups to begin brainstorming ideas for an installation art piece that represents their goal/target. Consider the following prompts:<br><em> What objects, materials, or symbols can represent the challenges and solutions related to the goal/target?<br></em> How can you engage sight, sound, touch, or even smell to create an immersive experience for the viewer?<br><em> Can you incorporate interactive elements that allow viewers to engage with the artwork and reflect on its message?<br></em> Consider how the installation will interact with the chosen space in the classroom or school.<br>Examples of installation art ideas connected to targets<br><em> </em>Target 7.1 \\- Access to Energy<em><br></em> Create a silhouette scene on a wall using cardboard cutouts. One side depicts a village in darkness, the other side shows the same village illuminated after gaining access to electricity. Use a lamp or flashlight on phone to cast light, demonstrating the transformative power of energy access.<br><em> String yarn or twine across a corner of the room, creating a web-like structure. Attach paper cutouts of houses, schools, and hospitals to the web, symbolizing how energy connects and empowers communities.<br></em> <em>Target 7.2 \\- Renewable Energy</em><br><em> Make simple pinwheels from colorful paper and attach them to recycled bottles or tubes. Arrange them in a cluster, creating a “wind farm” that spins with even a gentle breeze.<br></em> Cut out various shapes from reflective and other materials to make a “solar garden” showcasing the power of the sun.<br><em> </em>Target 7.3 \\- Energy Efficiency<em><br></em> Collect common household items or cut out paper to represent these items. Create a display showing the “before” (inefficient) and “after” (energy-efficient) versions of these items. Add labels explaining the energy savings associated with each upgrade.<br><em> A series of everyday objects (either real/recycled or created as art) transformed to be more energy efficient (again, can either be real or transformed in an imaginary/sci fi sort of way), highlighting the potential for innovation.<br></em> <em>Target 7.a \\- International Cooperation</em><br><em> Each student in the group decorates a “quilt square” with symbols or images representing their culture and ideas about clean energy. Connect the squares to create a collaborative quilt symbolizing global cooperation.<br></em> Cut out paper lanterns or light bulb shapes and have students decorate them with messages of hope and collaboration related to clean energy. String lanterns together to create a chain that stretches across the room.<br><em> </em>Target 7.b \\- Infrastructure and Technology<em><br></em> Collect pieces of old electronics or cut out/create representations and create a sculpture representing the evolution of technology. Highlight how innovation can lead to more sustainable energy solutions.\n<ul>\n<li>Use recycled cardboard and other materials to create a miniature model of an ideal city powered by renewable energy sources. Include things like wind turbines, solar panels, green spaces, and efficient transportation systems.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Creation and Construction"} content={"<p>Have groups gather their chosen materials and begin constructing their installation art pieces.<br>Encourage students to adapt and modify their installation art pieces based on available resources and their own creativity.<br>Circulate around the classroom, encouraging teamwork, problem solving, and creative expression throughout the process. Ask questions such as:<br><em> Tell me a bit about the concept behind your installation. What message are you trying to convey?<br></em> How are you using these specific materials to represent your assigned target?<br><em> What challenges have you encountered so far, and how are you overcoming them?<br></em> How is your group collaborating and sharing ideas during the construction process?\n<ul>\n<li>What are some unexpected or surprising elements you’ve incorporated into your artwork?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

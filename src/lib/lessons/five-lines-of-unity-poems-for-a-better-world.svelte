	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing the cinquain as a kind of poetry. Explain that it’s a short, five-line poem that follows a very specific structure based on the number of words in each line.

Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What did you notice about the poem?</li>\n<li>How does each line build on the one before it?</li>\n<li>How does the final word tie the whole poem together?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Next, introduce Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships. It means that for us to solve big problems like hunger or poverty, we have to work together as a team.

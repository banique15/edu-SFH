	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by playing short audio clips of various water sounds such as:<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LMqOdCHQWw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flowing River</a><br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX6kn9_U8qk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rainstorm</a><br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn9F19Hi1Lk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ocean Waves</a><br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNwPVp4gu14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trickling Water</a><br>Start a discussion sparking reflection on the importance of water, asking questions such as:<br><em> How do these sounds make you feel?<br></em> What role does water play in your daily life?<br><em> Can you think of any specific times when you didn't have access to clean water? How did that affect you?<br></em> Can you imagine daily life without access to clean water?<br>Re-introduce Global Goal 5 if necessary: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.<br>Explain that music and rhythm have a unique ability to stick in our minds. Think of catchy jingles from commercials or how easily we remember song lyrics (especially choruses, the most catchy parts of the song). The same principle can be applied to learning more complex information.<br>Research suggests that rhythm can enhance brain activity and improve memory recall. When we associate information with a rhythm or melody, it creates stronger neural connections, making it easier to retrieve and remember the information later.<br>Introduce the concept of mnemonics \\- memory aids that use patterns of letters, ideas, or associations to help us remember facts and concepts. Explain that music and rhymes can be powerful mnemonic devices.<br><em> Music Staff: \"Every Good Boy Does Fine\" (E,G,B,D,F)<br></em> Colors of the Rainbow: \"ROYGBIV\" (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)\n<ul>\n<li>Order of planets: \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles\" (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)</li>\n</ul><br>Music can also evoke emotions, which can further enhance memory and engagement. When we feel connected to the information on an emotional level, we are more likely to remember it and be motivated to take action.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Target Breakdown: Rhyme Time"} content={"<p>Divide students into groups of 3-4, assigning each a goal/target.<br>Have each group:<br><em> Rewrite their target in as simple a way as they possibly can, for a younger audience (have students think of elementary school kids)<br></em> Brainstorm a catchy rhyme or short jingle that encapsulates the target's essence. Examples for inspiration:<br><em> </em>Target 6.1 \\- Clean Water for All<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Everyone deserves clean water to drink.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Clean water, clear and bright, a basic need a human right\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"SAFE\", <strong>S</strong>afe water, <strong>A</strong>ffordable access <strong>F</strong>or <strong>E</strong>veryone<br><em> </em>Target 6.2 \\- Sanitation and Hygiene<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Toilets and handwashing for a healthy world.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Wash your hands, use the loo, germs away, health for you\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"WASH\", <strong>WA</strong>ter, <strong>S</strong>anitation, and <strong>H</strong>ygiene<br><em> </em>Target 6.3 \\- Improve Water Quality<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Keep our water clean and stop pollution.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> No more dumping, keep it pure, clean water is the only cure\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"RRR\", <strong>R</strong>educe pollution, <strong>R</strong>ecycle water, <strong>R</strong>euse safely<br><em> </em>Target 6.4 \\- Water Use Efficiency<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Use water wisely, don't let it run dry.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Turn off the tap, fix the leak, save water every week\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"WISE\", <strong>W</strong>ater efficiency, <strong>I</strong>ncreased sustainability, <strong>S</strong>carcity addressed, <strong>E</strong>veryone benefits.<br><em> </em>Target 6.5 \\- Integrated Water Management<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Work together to manage water fairly.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Rivers flow, borders cross, sharing water, no big loss\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"TEAM\", <strong>T</strong>ransboundary cooperation, <strong>E</strong>cosystem protection, <strong>A</strong>ll levels involved, <strong>M</strong>anagement that is smart.<br><em> </em>Target 6.6 \\- Protect Ecosystems<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Keep our rivers, lakes, and wetlands healthy<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Protect the wetlands, save the streams, healthy ecosystems make happy dreams\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"WISE\", <strong>N</strong>urture our water ecosystems, <strong>A</strong>quifers and lakes, <strong>T</strong>rees and rivers, <strong>U</strong>niting, <strong>R</strong>estoring, <strong>E</strong>veryone agrees.<br><em> </em>Target 6.a \\- International Cooperation<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Help other countries get clean water too.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Share the knowledge, lend a hand, clean water across every land\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"BUILD\", <strong>B</strong>uild capacity, <strong>U</strong>nited for water, <strong>I</strong>nternational support, <strong>L</strong>asting solutions, <strong>D</strong>eveloping nations thrive.<br><em> </em>Target 6.b \\- Community Participation<em><br></em> <em>Simplified Target:</em> Together to keep our water clean.<br><em> </em>Rhyme/Jingle:<em> Community voices strong and clear, clean water is something we all want here\\!<br></em> <em>Mnemonic:</em> \"VOICE\", <strong>V</strong>alue local knowledge, <strong>O</strong>pen communication, <strong>I</strong>nclusion for all, <strong>C</strong>ommunity power, <strong>E</strong>mpowerment thorugh action.<br>Explain to students that they will now enhance their rhymes by adding rhythm and melody. Emphasize that this will make their presentations more engaging and memorable, aiding in the memorization of Global Goal 5.<br>If instruments are not available, guide students to create rhythms using their bodies. Demonstrate simple clapping patterns, snapping, stomping, and tapping on various surfaces. Encourage experimentation with different rhythms and patterns.<br>If instruments are accessible, keep it simple. Allow students to quickly explore, creating melodies or accompaniments for their rhymes. Guide them to also keep it simple and repetitive, focusing on catchy tunes that are easy to remember.<br>Emphasize the importance of teamwork as groups create a unified rhythm and melody that complements their rhyme.<br>Assure students that there is no one \"right\" way to create music. Encourage them to have fun, be creative, and try different approaches.<br>Give students time to rehearse their performance, ensuring that everyone feels confident and comfortable with their role.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Mnemonic Mashup: Memorization and Performance"} content={"<p>Have each group present their rhyme/jingle to the class, showcasing their chosen rhythm and melody.<br>Write each groups mnemonic/rhyme on the board or large paper so classmates can easily follow along, and also to assist in memorization.<br>Encourage students to offer positive feedback and suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, catchiness, and connection to the goal/target.<br>If time allows, the class can practice and memorize each groups rhyme/jingle, fostering a sense of collective learning and collaboration.<br>After all the performances, facilitate a discussion about its overall impact and effectiveness. Ask questions like:<br><em> Did the combination of mnemonics, rhymes, and rhythms help you remember the  key messages of Global Goal 5?<br></em> Which elements of the performance were particularly memorable or impactful?<br><em> How did the collaborative nature of the performance reflect the importance of working together to achieve clean water and sanitation for all?<br></em> Did any of the rhymes or or melodies evoke specific emotions in you?

	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing Global Goal 15. Explain that this goal is about protecting the land we live on, big and small. It’s about taking care of all the plants and animals that call these places home.<br>`\t`Introduce the concept of “Follow the Leader” as a way to explore these big ideas. Explain that this is not just a dance/movement game; it’s a way to work together as a group to tell an embodied story. The focus is on creativity, simple movements, and group cooperation.<br>`\t`Demonstrate a few simple dance movements, and have students follow with prompts like:\n<ul>\n<li>Follow my movements as I show the gentle sway of a tree in the wind.</li>\n<li>Flowing, graceful movements.</li>\n<li>Follow me as I show the sharp, quick movements of a small lizard.</li>\n<li>Quick, jerky movements.</li>\n<li>Follow me as I show the slow, steady growth of a plant.</li>\n<li>Start small and expand movements slowly.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`These examples will help students understand they are not just copying movements, but embodying an idea through dance.</p>"} />

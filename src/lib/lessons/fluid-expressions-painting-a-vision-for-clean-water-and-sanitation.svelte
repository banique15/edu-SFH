On people? On the environment?</li>\n<li>Contrastingly, what opportunities or benefits do you see in the pristine images and videos? How might access to clean water change lives?</li>\n<li>Do you think art can be a tool to make people care about environmental issues?

Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._61_\\(Rust_and_Blue\\\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">No. 61 (Rust and Blue)</a>), Mark Rothko: This painting features contrasting colors that evoke a sense of depth and mystery, inviting viewers to explore their own interpretations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_and_Sea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mountains and Sea</a>, Helen Frakenthaler: This groundbreaking work, created using her signature \"soak-stain\" technique, features flowing colors that evoke a sense of fluidity and movement, reminiscent of water.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.frankenthalerfoundation.org/artworks/riverhead/details/all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Riverhead</a>, Helen Frankenthaler: The flowing, watery forms and colors in \"Riverhead\" can symbolize the essential nature of water, its dynamic movement, and the interconnectedness of water systems.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/clyfford-still-ph-950\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PH-950</a>, Clyfford Still: The contrasting colors and textures in this abstract piece can be interpreted as representing the stark difference between polluted and clean environments. The jagged edges and dark hues may evoke feelings of unease or alarm, highlighting the negative impacts of pollution on our water sources and the urgency of addressing this issue.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.si.edu/object/light-depth%3Ahmsg_2018.036\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Light Depth</a>, Sam Gilliam: This large-scale, draped canvas installation, with its vibrant colors and flowing forms, can evoke a sense of the vastness and power of water. It can also represent the importance of access to clean water for all, as well as the need for sustainable water management practices to preserve this precious resource.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Discuss how colors and their interplay can evoke emotions and convey ideas without relying on representational forms.</p>"} />

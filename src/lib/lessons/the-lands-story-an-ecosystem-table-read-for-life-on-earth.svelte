	<CustomSection title={"Brainstorming Sounds and Feelings: The Ecosystem’s Voice"} content={"<p>Tell students they will now participate in a brainstorming activity where they will use sounds to bring ecosystems to life, with the goal of thinking about how different parts of every ecosystem have their own “voice.”<br><em>The Healthy Ecosystem</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Challenge students to use their voices (and sound-making objects if applicable) to create a soundscape.

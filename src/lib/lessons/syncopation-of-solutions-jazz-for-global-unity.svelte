	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with an engaging introducing to jazz and jazz harmony.\n<ul>\n<li>Jazz music is a rich and diverse genre with a strong emphasis on improvisation, collaboration, and call-and-response. While it can be complex, the underlying principles of working together musically make it a great way to understand global partnerships.</li>\n</ul><br>Explain key concepts.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rhythm Section:</em> The foundation (like drums and bass) providing a steady beat - representing the consistent efforts of many.</li>\n<li><em>Melody:</em> The main tune - representing individual goals or initiatives.</li>\n<li><em>Harmony:</em> The chords supporting the melody - representing the framework of cooperation and shared values.</li>\n<li><em>Improvisation:</em> Individual musicians creating their own melodies within the harmonic structure - representing diverse contributions and innovations.</li>\n<li><em>Call and Response:</em> A musical phrase played by one musician and answered by another - representing dialogue and exchange.</li>\n</ul><br>Play short, accessible examples of jazz, showcasing these elements (e.g., a simple blues progression with a clear rhythm section and a short improvised melody).<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mss0u20GmBo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jazz Guitar Backing Track</a> in C with improvisation.</li>\n<li><em>Focus:</em> This is a classic and easy to follow structure. Point out the consistent beat provided by the bass and drums (the partnership foundation), the simple chord changes (the shared framework), and the soloist creating their own melody within that framework (individual contributions).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryNtmkfeJk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Now’s the Time</a> by Charlie Parker (excerpt)</li>\n<li><em>Focus:</em> While Charlie Parker’s playing can be complex, the head (main melody) of this tune is quite straightforward, and many recordings feature a clear, walking bass line and swinging drums. If listening to an excerpt, listen to the beginning and a short section of a saxophone solo (for example). Highlight the clear rhythm section, the main melody played together, and then Parker’s improvisation as a unique voice within the established harmony.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZcuSBouhVA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freddie Freeloader</a> by Miles Davis (play excerpt)</li>\n<li><em>Focus:</em> This is a slower blues with a very laid-back feel. The rhythm section is clear and supportive, and the solos are often melodic and accessible. Listen to the head (main melody) and a short trumpet or saxophone solo (for example). Emphasize the supportive rhythm section and how the soloist builds upon the simple harmonic foundation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqdgPUumyNA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watermelon Man</a> by Herbie Hancock (original/early version) (excerpt)</li>\n<li><em>Focus:</em> The original version has a funky blues feel with a clear groove. The main melody is catchy, and improvisations often follow the blues changes in a relatively accessible way. Show how different instruments (piano, bass, drums, etc.) create a cohesive rhythmic foundation, and how the soloing instruments adds its own voice.</li>\n</ul><br>Tips:\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the excerpts 30-60 seconds to maintain focus.</li>\n<li>Clearly point out the different musical elements as they are played.</li>\n<li>Don’t get bogged down in complex jazz theory if the class isn’t ready for it. The goal is to illustrate the basic concepts of collaboration and individual contribution within a shared structure.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to listen for how the different “voices” (instruments) interact.</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Emphasize the need for collaboration across nations and sectors.<br>Connect jazz harmony and Global Goal 17 with an engaging discussion. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can the different instruments in a jazz ensemble working together represent the various partners needed to achieve the Global Goals for Sustainable Development?</li>\n<li>How can the steady rhythm section symbolize consistent support?</li>\n<li>How can improvisation represent individual contributions within a shared framework?</li>\n<li>How can call and response mirror international dialogue and exchange?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Collaborative Jazz “Improvisation” with Body Percussion"} content={"<em>Rhythm Section Foundation:</em> Guide the class through collectively creating a simple “rhythm section” using body percussion (stomping a steady beat, clapping a simple pattern).<br><em>Melody Lines (Call and Response):</em> Divide the class into smaller groups (representing different countries or sectors). Lead with a short, simple rhythmic phrase (the “melody” or initial initiative) using body percussion or voice. Each group will then “improvise” a response, creating their own rhythmic phrase that complements or answers the original.<br><em>Layering and Harmony:</em> As different groups create their “melodies” and responses, layer them on top of the collective “rhythm section.” Guide the layering, asking groups to come in at different times, creating a sense of musical “harmony” through the combination of rhythms.<br>Example of how this could play out (NOTE: Group A and B should each be hal of the class. The rest of the groups can be 1-3 students each):\n<ul>\n<li>Alright everyone, let’s create our steady foundation, our “rhythm section.” We’ll start with a simple stomp on the beat. Let’s count to four and stomp on each number: ONE(stomp), TWO(stomp), THREE(stomp), FOUR(stomp). Can you all join in, keeping a steady, even, beat?</li>\n<li>(Class joins in, stomping a steady four-beat pattern.)</li>\n<li>Great! Now, let’s add another layer. Group A (pointing to one group) can you clap a simple pattern on top of our stomp? Let’s try: CLAP-CLAP (on beats 1 and 3), rest-rest (on beats 2 and 4). Group A, can you come in with that?</li>\n<li>Group A starts clapping their pattern in time with the stomping.</li>\n<li>Excellent! We have our steady foundation and our first layer. Now, let’s move to “Melody Lines” with “Call and Response.”</li>\n<li><strong>(Lead the “Melody Lines).</strong></li>\n<li>Okay, Group B (pointing to another group), I’m going to give you a short rhythmic phrase - our “melody” or initial initiative. Listen: SNAP-SNAP(beat 1), rest(beat 2), SNAP(beat 3), rest(beat 4). Can you repeat that back to me?</li>\n<li>Group B repeats the snap pattern.</li>\n<li>Fantastic! Now, Group C (pointing to another section or calling on a specific student(s)), you are going to create a short “improvisation” as a response to Group B’s phrase. Listen to Group B’s rhythm, and then create your own short pattern that feels like an answer. It doesn’t have to be the same, just something that fits with it. Maybe a clap pattern or a vocal sound. Give it a try!</li>\n<li>Group C listens to Group B and creates their own response rhythm, with guidance if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>(Lead the “Layering and Harmony).</strong></li>\n<li>Alright, let’s layer this all together. Everyone keep the steady stomp going. Group A, keep your clap pattern. Group B, let’s hear your snap phrase, and Group C, bring in your response whenever it feels right.</li>\n<li>The class creates a multi-layered rhythmic piece with stomping, the initial snap phrase, and the improvised responses.</li>\n<li>Listen to how we all have our own part, our own “voice,” but we’re all working together within the same framework of the beat. This is like different countries or sectors bringing their unique contributions to achieve the Global Goals.</li>\n<li><strong>(Can then lead with another “call” rhythm, and different groups/students can take turns responding, creating a dynamic and evolving piece.)</strong></li>\n<li>Now, Group D (pointing to another section or calling on a specific student(s)), let’s hear your “call” - a new short rhythm. And Group E, you’ll create the “response this time!</li>\n<li><strong>(The activity continues, with different groups leading and responding. Pause periodically to connect the musical elements to specific targets/ideas of Global Goal 17, as outlined in the lesson plan.)</strong></li>\n</ul><br>As the collaborative musical piece evolves, periodically pause and ask students to connect the musical elements to specific ideas or Targets of Global Goal 17. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>How does our steady rhythm section relate to the consistent support needed for developing countries? (Target 17.2)</li>\n<li>How does the “call and response” between groups represent international cooperation and knowledge sharing? (Target 17.6)</li>\n<li>How does each group’s unique rhythmic “improvisation” symbolize the diverse contributions of different partners? (Target 17.16)</li>\n<li>Can we create a moment where our rhythms build in intensity and complexity, representing the mobilization of additional financial resources? (Target 17.3)</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by playing a song that is known for its message of empowerment or challenging societal/gender norms, preferably one with a strong female artist or perspective.<br>Song Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Respect, Aretha Franklin</li>\n<li>Run the World (Girls), Beyoncé</li>\n<li>Confident, Demi Lovato</li>\n<li>This Is Me, Keala Settle (from The Greatest Showman)</li>\n<li>Roar, Katy Perry</li>\n<li>Fight Song, Rachel Platten</li>\n<li>Girl on Fire, Alicia Keys</li>\n<li>Brave, Sara Bareilles</li>\n<li>Rise Up, Andra Day</li>\n</ul><br>After playing the song(s), facilitate a discussion to unpack the message and connect it to the broader theme of gender equality. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did this song make you feel? Did it make you feel strong, brave, or happy? What parts of the music (like the beat, the singing, etc.) make you feel that way?</li>\n<li>What do you think the main message of the song is? What is the singer trying to tell us?</li>\n<li>Are there any specific words or phrases in the song that stood out to you? Why?</li>\n<li>How can this song’s message relate to the idea of fairness and equal chances for everyone, no matter their gender?</li>\n<li>Can you think of other songs that make you feel strong or happy, or that talk about important ideas?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Building Our Fairness Playlist"} content={"<p>Explain that the students will create a song web theme together.<br>Draw a large circle in the center of the whiteboard/paper. Write “Gender Equality” inside.<br>Then draw several branches from the center, labeling them with different aspects of fairness and equality.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Branch 1: Feeling Strong and Brave</em> (e.g., standing up for yourself, being a leader, finding your voice.)</li>\n<li><em>Branch 2: Being Fair and Respectful</em> (e.g., treating everyone equally, sharing opportunities, listening to all voices).</li>\n<li><em>Branch 3: Celebrating Differences and Being Unique</em> (e.g., showing that it’s cool to like different things, everyone belongs, accepting all talents and differences).</li>\n<li><em>Branch 4: Working Together</em> (e.g., teamwork, helping each other, solving problems as a group)</li>\n</ul><br>For each branch, ask: What kind of song would fit this theme? Think about the beat (slow/fast), the instruments you’d hear, the singer’s voice (strong/soft), and the kinds of words you’d expect to hear in the lyrics. Write these musical qualities under each theme on the web.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feeling Strong and Brave:</em> Fast beat, strong drums, powerful voice, words like “fight,” “rise,” “can do,” “unbreakable.”</li>\n<li><em>Being Fair and Respectful:</em> Steady beat, calm music, kind voice, words about “listen,” “share,” “together,” “equal.”</li>\n<li><em>Celebrating Differences and Being Unique:</em> Upbeat tempo, lots of different instruments, playful voice, words about “shine,” “different,” “sparkle,” “me.”</li>\n<li><em>Working Together:</em> Strong, marching beat, many instruments playing together, voices singing together (chorus), words about “team,” “build,” “help,” “hand in hand.”</li>\n</ul><br>Summarize: This web gives us a great starter map for finding amazing songs for our playlists.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

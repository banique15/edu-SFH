	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and imaginations to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 12 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to be smarter about the things we use and make. Emphasize that this means:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Being mindful:</em> Thinking about what we buy and if we really need it.</li>\n<li><em>Reducing waste:</em> Using less, and throwing away less.</li>\n<li><em>Reusing and recycling:</em> Finding new lives for old things.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`It’s about making things in a way that’s good for the planet and making sure we don’t use up all our planet’s resources, so there’s enough for a long time.<br>`\t`Introduce the concept of Guided Imagery. Explain that guided imagery is a technique where you use descriptive language to guide students to visualize and imagine a specific scenario or story. Clarify that the goal today is for students to tap into their imagination and explore these visualizations through movement, connecting their mind and body.<br>`\t`Emphasize that there or no right or wrong ways to move, and the students will be encouraged to interpret the imagery in their own way.<br>`\t`Lead a brief, simple guided imagery exercise to introduce the concept.\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to close their eyes gently or soften their gaze. Guide them through the exercise, slowly and with intention (no movement is necessary from students during this guided introduction):</li>\n<li>Imagine you are a tiny seed in the ground. Feel how small and still you are. Now, imagine a gentle rain starts to fall. Slowly, your roots begin to grow down, and your stem pushes up towards the sun. Feel yourself stretching and growing. Now, you are a tall, strong plant, swaying gently in the breeze. Your branches reach up towards the sky, and you feel a sense of strength and life.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Facilitate a short discussion after this introduction, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What images came to mind during that exercise?</li>\n<li>How did the imagery of the seed and the rain make your body want to move?</li>\n<li>How can we use our imagination and movement to explore other ideas?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Object Transformation Stretch"} content={"<p>`\t`<em>The First Object</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students imagine that they are an everyday object that is old and used, like an empty bottle or a pair of shoes that have been thrown away.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions to help students imagine the movements that might connect to these objects:</li>\n<li>What kind of shape does your body make?</li>\n<li>Is it hard, stiff, and empty?</li>\n<li>How does your body feel when it’s still and discarded?</li>\n<li>What does it feel like to be a flat piece of cardboard, or a crumpled up can?</li>\n<li>If you had a voice, what sound would you make as an old, tired object? Can you translate that into a movement?</li>\n<li>Where does your body feel heavy or useless?</li>\n<li>Guide students to make simple shapes with their bodies.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Transformation</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, have students imagine a wave a creative energy washing over them, and slowly, the old shape of the object (and themselves) begins to transform into something new and useful.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions to help students imagine the movements that might connect to this transformation:</li>\n<li>What does your body become now?</li>\n<li>How does your body feel as it slowly changes and stretches into something new?</li>\n<li>What movement shows the new object’s purpose?</li>\n<li>If your new shape had a feeling, what would it be? Can you translate that feeling into movement?</li>\n<li>Where in your body do you feel this new, creative energy the most?</li>\n<li>How does your body show that it’s no longer just a used object, but a useful and vibrant part of the world?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Second Object</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, ask students to imagine a different object, also old and used, and have them make the shape inspired by this object.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Second Transformation</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Students again transform into a new, useful object, showing this tranformation with their bodies and movement.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming the ability to connect movement and imagination to the idea of repurposing and reuse.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Consumption Lifecycle Map"} content={"<p>`\t`Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a large piece of paper and markers.<br>`\t`Instruct each group to draw a simple flow chart or comic strip type drawing with three or four panels. The drawing should include:\n<ul>\n<li><em>(Panel 1) Creation/Use:</em> An object being made or used for the first time.</li>\n<li><em>(Panel 2) Waste:</em> The object is thrown away.</li>\n<li><em>(panel 3) Solution/Reuse:</em> The object is repurposed or recycled.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`For each panel/section, instruct groups to brainstorm:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feelings:</em> what emotion or feeling goes with this part of the object’s journey? (e.g., happy, busy, sad, wasteful, smart, proud).</li>\n<li><em>Key Movements:</em> What specific movements or body shapes would show this part of the story? (e.g., strong repetitive movements, slow heavy movements, light bouncy movements).</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can you show the sad feeling of trash with a body shape?</li>\n<li>What kind of movement shows recycling as an active and happy thing?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Guided Imagery and Movement Exploration"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the class will now go on a guided movement journey based on the brainstormed ideas.<br>`\t`Lead the class through a series of imagery sequences, with students following along with their own organic movements.<br>`\t`Play a mix of music, choosing what is appropriate for your students and classroom.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7SS57LFPco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Merry-Go-Round of Life”</a>, Joe Hisaishi (from Howl’s Moving Castle)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMHH9bOPa28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Scientist”</a> (Instrumental), Coldplay</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s6RjtOBlh0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Last of Us Main Theme”</a>, Gustavo Santaolalla</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Yd6KluSEk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Promise”</a>, Secret Garden</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gydWS-cJ-wM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Dune OST - Main Theme”</a>, Hans Zimmer</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7exqZSLhk4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Arrival of the Birds &amp; Transformation”</a>, Cinematic Orchestra</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=S1uWHjhluTI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Married Life”</a>, Michael Giacchino (from Up)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbNZfdap5dw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Immigrant Song”</a> (Instrumental), Led Zeppelin</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Guided Imagery Prompts<br>`\t`<em>(Phase 1) The Problem:</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you are an object being made in a large factory. You move with a fast, repetitive rhythm.</li>\n<li>Guide students to move quickly and robotically.</li>\n<li>Now, you are used up and thrown away. Feel your body become heavy, slow, and discarded, like trash. Feel how wasteful that is.</li>\n<li>Guide students into slow, heavy, slumped movements.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>(Phase 2) The Solution, Transformation and Reuse</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, imagine a wave of creativity and change washes over you. You feel a new, smart idea! Slowly, your body begins to transform and stretch, becoming a new, useful, and beautiful thing.</li>\n<li>Guide students through a slow, expansive, and creative transformation.</li>\n<li>You are now part of a community that reuses, reduces, and recycles. Your movement is light, bouncy, and joyful, showing that you are part of a sustainable world!</li>\n<li>Guide students in light, free, and happy movements.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>(Phase 3) Hope for the Future</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, imagine a world where every object has a second life, where there is no waste. How do you move in that world? Is your movement calm and flowing? Is it strong and connected?</li>\n<li>Guide students through a peaceful, unified, and strong collective movement.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Encourage students throughout to listen to their bodies, connect with the emotions of the imagery, and explore different ways of interpreting the visualizations through movement.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Creative Movement Exploration"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that there will now be a short period of free movement exploration. Instruct students to reflect on the internal images and emotions they experiences during the guided imagery.<br>`\t`Invite students to explore their own movement responses to the themes of consumption, waste, and sustainability.<br>Provide prompts or suggestions to guide the exploration, if helpful. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>How would you move to represent the idea of excessive consumption?</li>\n<li>Can you show through movement the concept of reducing waste?</li>\n<li>How can you express your hope for a sustainable future through your body?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did the guided imagery and movement exploration help you connect with the concepts of responsible consumption and production on a deeper, more embodied level?</li>\n<li>What sensations or emotional shifts did you experience in your body as you moved through the different visualizations related to Global Goal 12?</li>\n<li>Did physically embodying concepts like waste transformation or sustainable practices offer you new insights that words alone might not have?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns through this movement activity?</li>\n<li>What is one key takeaway about responsible consumption and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, initial guided imagery exercise, brainstorm, creative movement explorations, and discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of responsible consumption and production (reducing waste, reusing, recycling), as demonstrated through the intentions and interpretations conveyed in the movements and verbal contributions during discussions.</li>\n<li>Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract or descriptive imagery into physical movement. Look for clear effort in expressing the feeling and concept.</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the small groups during the brainstorm and creative movement, respecting the diverse interpretations and contributing cohesively.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussions.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

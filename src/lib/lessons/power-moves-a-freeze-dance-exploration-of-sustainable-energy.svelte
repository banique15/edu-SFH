	<Introduction content={"<p>Start with a series of dynamic stretches to warm up muscles and increase blood flow. Some examples include:<br><em> Arm circles: Forward and backward arm circles to loosen up shoulders and upper back.<br></em> Leg swings: Side-to-side and front-to-back leg swings to engage hip flexors and hamstrings.<br><em> Torso twists: Gentle torso twists to mobilize the spinte and core.<br></em> Jumping jacks or high knees: Light cardio exercises to get the heart rate up.<br>Encourage students to move freely and explore different ways to moving their bodies. Play some upbeat music to set the mood and get them energized if desired.<br>During the warm ups, explain that just as dance requires energy to move, our society needs energy to function. Highlight the importance of choosing sustainable energy sources that are like a long-lasting battery for the planet, ensuring we can keep “dancing” and thriving for generations to come.<br>Introduce sustainable energy by asking students what they know about it and why it is important.<br>Explain that sustainable energy refers to energy sources that are renewable and do not harm the environment.<br>Discuss the negative impacts of fossil fuels on the planet and the urgent need to transition to cleaner energy sources.<br>Highlight the benefits of sustainable energy, such as:<br><em> Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.<br></em> Improved public health and environmental quality.<br><em> Increased energy security and independence.<br></em> Job creation and economic growth in the renewable energy sector.<br>Re-introduce Global Goal 7 if necessary: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Freeze Dancing with Energy Themes"} content={"<p>Clearly introduce and explain the rules of freeze dancing to students.<br><em> When the music plays, students can dance and move freely, expressing themselves however they like.<br></em> When the music stops, everyone must freeze in place immediately.<br><em> \\[Optional, depending on desired level of competition\\] Any movement after the music stops results in elimination from the round.<br>Connect freeze dancing to Global Goal 7<br></em> <em>Energy and Movement:</em> Just as dance requires energy to move, our society needs energy to function.<br><em> </em>Sudden Stops and Renewable Energy:<em> The sudden stops in music are similar to the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources like solar and wind.<br></em> Advancements in energy storage technologies are like learning to “hold your post” even when the “music” (energy source) is temporarily unavailable.<br><em> </em>Creativity and Innovation:<em> The creativity and innovation expressed in dance moves mirror the need for innovative solutions to transition to a sustainable energy future. Encourage students to think outside the box.<br>Start the music and encourage students to express themselves.<br>Pause the music at random intervals, prompting students to freeze in creative poses.<br>During freezes, call out specific energy-related themes or prompts, such as:<br></em> <em>Renewable Energy:</em><br><em> Freeze like a solar panel soaking up the sun\\!<br></em> Show me the power of wind turbines\\!<br><em> Show me the power of the sun\\!<br></em> <em>Energy Efficiency:</em><br><em> Freeze in a pose that conserves energy\\!<br></em> Imagine you’re an energy efficient appliance.<br><em> Imagine you’re a tightly sealed window\\!<br></em> Become an LED light bulb, shining brightly but using minimal energy\\!<br><em> </em>Global Cooperation:<em><br></em> Form a group sculpture representing international collaboration for clean energy.<br><em> </em>Access to Energy:<em><br></em> Strike a post representing the importance of energy access for all.<br><em> Show me the joy of a family finally having electricity in their home.<br></em> Freeze in a position that illustrates the importance of energy for education and opportunity.\n<ul>\n<li>Become a beacon of light\\!</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Energy Transformation Freeze Dance Challenge"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups (3-5 students)<br>Explain that each group will be assigned a renewable energy source. Options:<br><em> Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal.<br>These can be assigned randomly or students can choose based on their interests.<br>Instruct each group to create a short dance sequence (approximately 30-60 seconds) that visually represents the transformation of their assigned energy source into usable electricity.<br>The choreography should showcase the journey of the energy, from its natural state to powering homes and communities.<br>Emphasize the use of levels, shapes, and dynamic movements to capture the essence of the energy transformation.<br>Explain the “Freeze Dance” twist:<br></em> The music will play continuously as groups perform their sequences.<br><em> Can choose one song to repeat or play a number of songs/playlist. Examples of themed songs to play:<br></em> Energy, The Apples in Stereo<br><em> Here Comes the Sun, The Beatles<br></em> Walking On Sunshine, Katrine &amp; The Waves<br><em> Windy, The Association<br></em> The Wind Cries Mary, Jimi Hendrix<br><em> Wind of Change, Scorpions<br></em> Blowin’ in the Wind, Bob Dylan<br><em> Wichita Lineman, Glen Campbell<br></em> It’s Electric, Metallica<br><em> Electric Car, They Might Be Giants<br></em> The Wind, Yusuf/Cat Stevens<br><em> Ride Like The Wind, Christopher Cross<br></em> Sixteen Tons, Tennessee Ernie Ford<br><em> Working in the Coal Mine, DEVO<br></em> Electric Slide, Electric Slide Music Makers<br><em> Electric Youth, Debbie Gibson<br></em> Soak Up The Sun, Sharyl Crow<br><em> Who Loves the Sun, The Velvet Underground<br></em> Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Elton John<br><em> California Sun, Ramones<br></em> Sunshine On My Shoulder, John Denver<br><em> The House of the Rising Sun, Nina Simone<br></em> Sheer Energy, Sly &amp; The Family Stone<br><em> High Voltage, AC/DC<br></em> The Power, SNAP\\!<br><em> Energy, Buzzcocks<br></em> Artificial Energy, The Byrds<br><em> Turn off the Lights, Teddy Pendergrass<br></em> Lights, Journey<br><em> Make a Circuit With Me, The Polecats<br></em> Walkin’ On The Sun, Smash Mouth<br><em> Sun Is Shining, Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers<br></em> Invisible Sun, The Police<br><em> Let The Sunshine In (Reprise), The 5th Dimension<br></em> I’ll Follow the Sun, The Beatles<br><em> Sunglasses at Night, Corey Hart<br></em> Solar Power, Lorde<br><em> The Electric Co., U2<br></em> Turn Your Lights Down Low, Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers<br><em> At random intervals, the music will be paused.<br></em> Groups must freeze instantly in a pose that captures a key moment in the energy transformation process.<br><em> For added challenge, have audience members call out specific stages of the transformation (e.g., “Show me the sun rays hitting the solar panel\\!”)<br>Once groups have had time to practice, have each group perform their short Energy Transformation Freeze Dance for the class, pausing the music at least once during each performance.<br>Example Choreography Prompts:<br></em> <em>Solar:</em> Begin with dancers curled up on the floor, representing photons in the sun. Gradually rise and expand, reaching towards the sky as the sun's energy is released. Form a panel-like shape with bodies, absorbing the light. Finally, flow and pulse with energy, symbolizing the electricity generated.<br><em> </em>Wind:<em> Start with dancers swaying gently, like blades of grass in a breeze. Build momentum with swirling and spiraling movements, representing the wind gathering strength. Culminate in a powerful, unified spinning motion, mirroring the rotation of a wind turbine.<br></em> <em>Hydro:</em> Begin with dancers flowing smoothly, like a calm river. Transition to dynamic jumps and cascading movements, illustrating the power of falling water. Converge into a tight formation, symbolizing the turbine harnessing the water's energy.<br><em> </em>Geothermal:<em> Start with dancers grounded and still, representing the Earth's heat trapped beneath the surface. Slowly build tension and heat with trembling and rising movements. Erupt with explosive energy, symbolizing the release of geothermal steam.<br>Encourage the audience to observe closely to understand the connection between the choreography, energy source, and transformation process being depicted.<br>Either after all or each performance(s) (depending on class and time allotted), facilitate a discussion where the groups discuss their creative choices and students share their observations and interpretations.<br></em> What was the most challenging part of creating your dance sequence?<br><em> How did you work together as a group to come up with your choreography?<br></em> What specific movements or formations did you use to represent the different stages of energy transformation?<br><em> How did you incorporate the freeze dance element into your performance?<br></em> What message or feeling did you want to convey through your dance?<br><em> What energy source did you think each group was representing?<br></em> What specific movements or formations helped you identify the energy source?<br><em> Were there any moments in the dances that particularly stood out to you? Why?<br></em> How did the freeze dance element enhance the performance?\n<ul>\n<li>What did you learn about the energy transformation process from watching the dances?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

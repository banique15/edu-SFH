	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting art class. Explain that they will use their imagination and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 8 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has a good job \\- one that is fair, safe, and where they are treated with respect. Emphasize that it's also about helping communities and countries grow stronger in a way that helps everyone and doesn't harm our planet. Explain that this means opportunities for learning, creating new businesses, and making sure everyone can work and earn a fair living.<br>Introduce the concept of optical illusions and Op Art.<br><em> Explain that optical illusions are tricky pictures that play with your eyes, making you see things that aren't really there, like lines that seem to wiggle or shapes that pop out.<br></em> Clarify that Op Art is a style of art that uses simple lines, shapes, and colors to create these amazing tricks, making the art seem to move, bulge, or shimmer.<br><em> Tell students that Op Art can help us think about things we don't always see at first glance, just like some important ideas about jobs and how our world's economy grows.<br>Show selected visual aids of Op Art pieces. Examples:<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-vasarely/zebra-1937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Zebras</em></a> by Victor Vasarely: This iconic painting uses alternating curved stripes to create the illusion of two zebras facing one another. They might seem to be moving or almost vibrating, showing how simple lines can create a sense of 3D form and motion.<br><em> <a href=\"https://bridget-riley.publications.britishart.yale.edu/catalogue/1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></em>Movement in Squares<em></a> by Bridget Riley: This piece uses many squares that gradually change in shape, creating an illusion that the entire image is waving or undulating, even though it is perfectly flat. It shows how small changes in repeated patterns can create a powerful sense of movement.<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1e37bafbf7b08436&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifMctzp1TKsyNFVB7ieeM5BtOD3QUw:1752774522776&amp;q=Marina+Apollonio&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeiAkWG4OlBE2zyCTMjPbGmMU8EWskMk2JSE__efdUJ3x-dd8PyEzi5Y9BtPQcYyUv-qqGBKcZRAt6t3qPZ3-iSZ6GtBRrUomyC2rUgS4TDygQfIaiWCtBi0gw2eDDygE9ZsO235rUXAUX4XMOSF0AZ0oNb07blcuzshZNivp14ZK7ZppxA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnv7T2ucSOAxUATDABHXoXJHkQtKgLKAF6BAgZEAE&amp;biw=1327&amp;bih=728&amp;dpr=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Works</a> by Marina Apollonio: Apollonio's artwork often uses repeating circles and lines in high contrast (like black and white) to create a strong illusion of a spinning spiral or tunnel that pulls the eye into the center. It gives the feeling of a dizzying movement or deep space.<br>Facilitate a discussion about the art. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> What tricky things do your eyes see in this artwork? Does it seem to wiggle, pop out, or shimmer?<br></em> What shapes and lines do you notice? Are they straight, curvy, repeating?<br><em> What colors did the artist use? Are they bright, dark, or contrasting?<br></em> How does this art make you feel? Does it feel energetic, dizzy, or calm?\n<ul>\n<li>How do you think Op Art, with its tricks and hidden patterns, could help us think about things we don't always see about jobs or how money moves in the world?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Job Illusion Card Sort"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).

What do you think each piece is trying to tell you about jobs or growth?<br>Encourage students to pay attention to:<br><em> What optical illusion do you see happening in the artwork? Does it seem to move, pop out, or shimmer?<br></em> What colors or patterns stand out? What do they make you feel?\n<ul>\n<li>Based on the illusion and colors, what big idea about jobs or growth do you think this artwork is trying to show?</li>\n</ul><br>Emphasize that students should come up with their own interpretations.<br>After the silent walk, gather the class together. Ask for a few volunteers to share one artwork they saw (not their own) and explain what optical illusion they saw and what message they interpreted from it about jobs or growth.<br>After they share, invite the artist to briefly reveal the specific Job Illusion Card idea they chose and how their art represents it.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<ReflectionQuestions questions={["How did creating Op Art illusions help you understand Global Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth in a new way?","What did you learn about how jobs and economies can be complex, sometimes having \"hidden\" sides that Op Art helped us see?","Which artworks or ideas from your classmates made you think or feel the most about jobs and growth, and why?","What does our activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 8?","What's one small action you feel inspired to take this week to be fair in your own work (like homework or chores) or support good work in your community?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<AssessmentCriteria criteria={["Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, individual art creation, and class discussions.","Understanding of the core concept of decent work and economic growth (fair jobs, safe workplaces, sustainable growth), as demonstrated through the symbolism and message in the individual Op Art piece and verbal explanations.","Originality and effort in creating the art piece. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 8 (does the artwork clearly represent an idea related to work or growth (challenge or solution) from the chosen card?), and use of Op Art technique (are there attempts to use lines, shapes, and colors from the chosen template to create an optical illusion that conveys the idea?).","Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion."]} {sdgColor} />

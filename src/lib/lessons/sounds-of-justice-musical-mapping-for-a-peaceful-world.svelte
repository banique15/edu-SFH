	<CustomSection title={"Storytelling and Musical Mapping"} content={"<p>Choose one of the provided stories (or write your own) about Global Goal 16.

	<CustomSection title={"Our Musical Map Performance"} content={"<p>Now, the class will work in three separate groups to create three different sections of a song, based on the musical map.<br>Split the class into three groups, and assign them each a section of the map they created:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Group 1, The Problem:</em> This group will be in charge of the opening section of the song. Based on the brainstormed problem section of the musical map, they will use their instruments and/or body percussion to create a short, musical piece that sounds tense, chaotic, or sad.</li>\n<li><em>Group 2, The Action:</em> This group will be in charge of the middle section of the song. Based on the brainstormed action section, they will create a short piece that sounds strong, purposeful, and determined.</li>\n<li><em>Group 3, The Solution:</em> This group will be in charge of the final selection of the song. Based on the brainstormed solution section, they will create a short piece that sounds peaceful, calm, and hopeful.</li>\n</ul><br>Give the groups about 5-8 minutes (or more, depending on how you’ve organized this lesson) to create their parts and practice as a group.<br>Circulate and offer guidance, helping them to use their instruments and boies to create the sounds they want.<br>Once all the groups have practiced their sections, bring them all together, while still maintaining each group separately.<br>Have each of the three groups perform their section, one after the other. This gives everyone a chance to hear the different musical “voices” and ideas. Encourage students to listen respectfully to each other’s work, paying attention to the unique rhythms and sounds each group created. This initial share is a moment to appreciate each part’s contribution to the whole story.<br>Next, it’s time to build the bridges between the sections. As a class, discuss how to transition smoothly from one part to the next. The Problem → The Action → The Solution.\n<ul>\n<li>For example, to transition from the chaotic problem to the purposeful action, a suggestion might be a slow, deliberate stomp from the whole class, or a single, unifying drum beat.</li>\n<li>To transition from the determined action to the peaceful solution, perhaps a gentle, fading sound like a soft shaker, or a quiet, collective sigh.</li>\n</ul><br>The entire class will practice these transitions together, reinforcing the idea that everyone has a part to play in connecting the different phases of the story.<br>Guide the class through a full run-through of the entire composition, from beginning to end. Use clear hand signals to cue each group to begin and end their section and to guide the transitions. Use your hands to control the dynamics (loudness or softness) and tempo (speed), shaping the performance to be as expressive as possible. After one or two rehearsals, the class will perform the song one last time as a final, powerful piece.<br>This collaborative effort demonstrates that when we all work together, we can create something beautiful and impactful.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"A Musical Gallery Walk"} content={"<p>After the final performance as a class, have a short, information “gallery walk” where students can walk around and speak to their peers about their experience.<br>Open the discussion with guiding questions and prompts like:\n<ul>\n<li>What was it like to create a story with sound and rhythm?</li>\n<li>How did the music make you feel during the problem part of the story?

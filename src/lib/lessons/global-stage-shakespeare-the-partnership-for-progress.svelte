	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing William Shakespeare. Explain that he was a famous writer from a long timea go, and his stories are still told today because they are about things that everyone can understand and relate to, like friendship, conflict, and love.<br>`\t`Explain that the class will be reading a simplified version of one of his plays, and also watching a performance of the same excerpt. The language from the excerpt might sound a little different, the context and feeling of the characters can help to figure out what is happening.<br>`\t`Review some of the things students will hear in the video excerpt/original Shakespearean version:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Iambic Pentameter (The Rhythm):</em> Explain that Shakespeare’s plays often have a fun, musical rhythm to them. Tell students to imagine a heartbeat rhythm: ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM. This rhythm gives the words a certain feel, and listening for it can help to understand the flow of the story.</li>\n<li><em>Thee and Thou (Old Pronouns):</em> Explain that in Shakespeare’s time, people used different words for “you.” When students see or hear “thee” or “thou,” they can just think of it as meaning “you.”</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Next, introduce UN Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships-the idea that people and countries need to work together to solve big problems. We’ll see how Shakespear’s stories about kings, queen,s and friends working together are really just examples of partnerships in action through drama.</p>"} />

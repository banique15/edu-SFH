	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing the concept of a jingle. Explain that jingles are like mini-songs that get stuck in our heads and are used to help people remember a product or an idea. They’re short, simple, and catchy.<br>`\t`Play a few examples of well-known jingles that students are likely to recognize. Ask them to listen for what makes the jingles so memorable.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Nationwide Insurance</em> “Nationwide is on your side”</li>\n<li><em>McDonald’s</em> “Ba da ba ba ba…I’m lovin’ it”</li>\n<li><em>State Farm Insurance</em> “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”</li>\n<li><em>Burger King</em> “Have it your way”</li>\n<li><em>Kit Kat</em> “Gimme a Break”</li>\n<li><em>Doublemint Gum</em> “Double Your Pleasure”</li>\n<li><em>O’Reilly Auto Parts</em> “O-O-O-O’Reilly…”</li>\n<li><em>Chili’s</em> “Baby Back Ribs”</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Facilitate a discussion, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some other jingles you can remember?</li>\n<li>What made these jingles easy to remember? (Encourage answers like repetition, a simple tune, a catchy phrase, etc.)</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Introduce Global Goal 14. Explain that the ocean is a home to countless animals and a vital part of our planet’s health. It provides us with food and the air we breathe. However, it is facing big problems. The lesson will focus on how we can use the power of jingles to help solve these problems.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Jingle Creation and Rehearsal"} content={"<p>`\t`Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students). Each group will create a jingle based on one of the ideas from the brainstorm. The jingle should have a clear hook (the catchy part) and a simple message related to Global Goal 14.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Step 1, The Message:</em> Each group will pick a simple, powerful message for their jingle.</li>\n<li>Example Message 1 (Pollution): Don’t toss your trash in the ocean.</li>\n<li>Example Message 2 (Action): Let’s clean up our oceans.</li>\n<li>Example Message 3 (Hope): The ocean needs us.</li>\n<li><em>Step 2, Lyric Writing:</em> Using the words from the brainstorming, each group will write short, simple lyrics for their jingle. The lyrics should be easy to understand and remember.</li>\n<li>Example Lyrics (linked to Example Message 1):</li>\n<li>Hook: Don’t throw your plastic in the sea!</li>\n<li>Verse 1: A fish is hungry, looking for food…it sees a bottle, that’s no good!</li>\n<li>Verse 2: The sea turtle swims, but he can’t get free…a tangled net is blocking the sea!</li>\n<li>Tagline: Help save the ocean for you and me!</li>\n</ul><br>Note: Jingle lyrics can be much more simple than the example given above.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Step 3, Melody and Rhythm:</em> Now, the groups will create a simple melody and a rhythm using their voices and percussion. Remind students that the  melody should be easy to sing and the rhythm should be simple and repetitive.</li>\n<li>Example Rhythm: For the “Don’t throw your plastic” jingle, the group might use a simple clap-stomp rhythm. (Clap) Don’t (Stomp) throw (Clap) your (Stomp) plastic…</li>\n<li><em>Step 4, Rehearsal:</em> The groups will practice their jingles. Encourage them to sing with confidence and to make sure their words and rhythms are in sync.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Jingle Performances"} content={"<p>`\t`Each group will perform their jingle for the class. Encourage students to be energetic and enthusiastic. After each performance, ask the class to reflect with guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What was the message of that jingle?</li>\n<li>What part of the jingle was the most memorable?</li>\n<li>How did the rhythm and melody help you understand the message?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of a simple, catchy song? How can something as short as a jingle be used to spread an important message about a big problem like ocean pollution?</li>\n<li>Did creating your jingle make you think differently about your own impact on the ocean?</li>\n<li>What is one simple action you could take after this lesson to help achieve Global Goal 14?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about working with your group to create something new?</li>\n<li>How did working together to make a jingle feel like working together to solve a big problem?</li>\n<li>Our jingles were a call to action. What kind of actions do you hope your jingle inspires people to take?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consisent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, jingle creation, rehearsal, and class discussion.</li>\n<li>Comprehension of Global Goal 14 and its themes. This will be shown through the thematic content of the jingle lyrics and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in crafting a catchy and memorable jingle that adheres to the basic structure and rhythmic characteristics.</li>\n<li>How clearly and powerfully the finished jingle communicates its intended message. Did the jingle successfully evoke thought or emotion related to ocean conservation?</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the group, contributing ideas, respecting diverse opinions, and collaborating cohesively during the songwriting and rehearsal process.</li>\n<li>Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life below water.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin with an introduction or reintroduction and explanation of UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and half and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of these ecosystems for all life on Earth.<br>Provide a holistic overview of the goal, highlighting key themes:\n<ul>\n<li>The beauty and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems.</li>\n<li>The interconnectedness of all living things.</li>\n<li>The threats to these ecosystems (deforestation, habitat loss, etc.).</li>\n<li>The urgency of conservation and sustainable practices.</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce “Follow the Leader” by explaining the basic concept:\n<ul>\n<li>One person leads, the everyone else copies their movements.</li>\n</ul><br>Explain that the class will utilize this format to explore different aspects of Life on Land.<br>Emphasize that the focus is on:\n<ul>\n<li>Simple, clear movements.</li>\n<li>Expressing ideas and emotions through movement.</li>\n<li>Working together as a group.</li>\n</ul><br>Start with a few simple examples\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone, follow me as I show the movement of wind through the trees.</li>\n<li>Now, follow me as I show the growth of a plant.</li>\n<li>Let’s all follow as I show the movement of a deer through the forest.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Guided Movement Exploration: Ecosystems and Threats"} content={"<p>Lead the class through a series of “Follow the Leader” sequences, each focusing on a specific aspect of Global Goal 15.<br>Emphaisze clear instructions, varied movement qualities, and inclusive language.<br>Examples of movement sequences:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Forest Ecosystem (Targets 15.1 and 15.2)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be the wind, you follow my movements as I sway the trees, rustle the leaves, and move through the forest. (Focus: flowing, gentle movements, variations in speed and intensity.)</li>\n<li>I’ll be a seed, you follow my movements as I sprout, grow, and reach for the sunlight (Focus: slow, upward movements, expanding gestures)</li>\n<li><em>Grassland Ecosystem (Targets 15.1 and 15.5)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be the tall grass, you follow my movements as I sway in the breeze, bend in the wind, and ripple across the landscape. (Focus: fluid, wave-like movements, use of levels (high and low).)</li>\n<li>I’ll be a grazing animal, you follow my movements as I move across the grassland, searching for food. (Focus: Grounded, purposeful movements, exploring different speeds and directions)</li>\n<li><em>Deforestation (Targets 15.2 and 15.9)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be the forest, full of life. You follow my movements as I show the trees standing tall and strong.

(Focus: sharp, forceful movements, restricted gestures.)</li>\n<li><em>Desertification (Target 15.3)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be the wind and the sun, drying out the land. You follow my movements as I show the parched earth, the cracked soil, and the scarcity of life. (Focus: dry, brittle movements, limited range of motion)</li>\n<li>I’ll be the rain, bringing life back to the land. Follow my movements as I show the softening of the soil, the growth of new plants. (Focus: Flowing, restorative movements, gentle and gradual.)</li>\n<li><em>Endangered Species (Targets 15.5 and 15.7)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be an endangered animal. Follow my movements as I show its beauty, its fragility, and its struggle to live. (Focus: Expressive movements, conveying vulnerability and strength.)</li>\n<li>I’ll be the threat of poaching. Follow my movements as I show the pursuit, the capture, and the loss. (Focus: sharp, aggressive movements, creating tension and urgency.</li>\n<li><em>Invasive Species (Target 15.8)</em></li>\n<li>I’ll be the native plant life. Follow my movements as I show the thriving ecosystem. (Focus: harmonious, balanced movements, showing interconnectedness.)</li>\n<li>I’ll be the invasive species, you follow my movements as I show its aggressive spread and disruption. (Focus: forceful, disruptive movements, taking over the space.)</li>\n</ul><br>Throughout the exercises:\n<ul>\n<li>Provide clear and concise instructions.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate the movements with energy and clarity.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to explore and interpret the imagery in their own way.</li>\n<li>Emphasize safety and inclusivity.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

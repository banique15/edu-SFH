	<Introduction content={"<p>Start by explaining UN Global Goal 13, utilizing the introductory video if desired. Emphaize that climate change is a problem that affects everyone, but especially communities who live close to nature, like those in the Amazon rainforest. Explain that their way of life and the rainforest itself are being threatened by changes in weather patterns, which can cause more extreme floods or droughts.<br>Tell students that they will learn about the Sateré-Mawé people, an indigenous community in the Brazilian Amazon. Their story is one of action and resilience. For centuries, they have lived in harmony with the forest and the rivers, but now they are seeing changes. The rivers they rely on for food and travel are changing, and some of the plants they use for medicine and food are becoming harder to find.<br>Watch a short video about the Sateré-Mawé people, if helpful.<br>Example:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QmVqSThq5I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secrets of the Amazon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpxJQPRMMY4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Green Trailblazers: Amazon activist fights to save her tribe</a></li>\n</ul><br>Create a Story Map together as a class.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Beginning: A Healthy Forest</em></li>\n<li>Guide students through this part of the story:</li>\n<li>The story starts with a beautiful, healthy forest. The Sateré-Mawé have lived here for centuries, and they know the land and the river better than anyone. They live in balance with their home.</li>\n<li>Ask for a volunteer(s) to come to the board and draw a simple picture of a wide, flowing river and lots of lush trees to show this part of the story.</li>\n<li><em>The Problem: A Changing Climate</em></li>\n<li>Guide students through this part of the story:</li>\n<li>Now, the story changes. The climate is getting warmer, and the weather is becoming unpredictable. The rivers the Sateré-Mawé rely on are getting lower and some of the plants they use for food and medicine are becoming harder to find.</li>\n<li>Ask for another volunteer(s) to draw this problem on the Story Map. They can draw a smaller, shrinking river or some dry, cracked land to show the effect of these changes.</li>\n<li><em>The Solution: Planting a Brighter Future</em></li>\n<li>Guide students through this part of the story:</li>\n<li>The Sateré-Mawé don’t give up. They decide to fight back, using their generations of knowledge about the forest to plant new trees and protect their home. Their story shows us that when you work together, you can find a solution.</li>\n<li>Ask for another volunteer(s) to come up and draw the community working as a team; maybe drawing planting seeds or caring for the trees.</li>\n<li><em>The Brighter Future: The Forest is Restored</em></li>\n<li>Guide students through this part of the story:</li>\n<li>Because of their hard work and determination, the story has a hopeful ending. The forest begins to come back to life. The rivers start to flow again, and the community is stronger than ever.</li>\n<li>Ask for a final volunteer(s) to draw a vibrant, healthy forest with a full river, or other symbols showing the amazing result of the community’s actions.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Narrate the story, connecting each part to the images on the map. This is a story not just of a problem, but of a real community’s courageous and effective response.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Brainstorming Sounds and Rhymes"} content={"<p>`\t`Brainstorm sounds and images for each part of the story, with examples and prompts below. This can be done with each student receiving their own paper and art supplies, or guided as a class with the information written on the board/large paper.<br>`\t`<em>Beginning: A Healthy Forest</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Prompt</em>: What does the Amazon sound like when it’s healthy and happy? What do you see?</li>\n<li><em>Brainstorm</em>: Encourage students to draw things like lush trees, animals, and flowing rivers. They might write words like peaceful, natural, or vibrant.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythmic Idea</em>: A calm, layered soundscape. Use a drum to represent the steady pulse of the river, with shakers for the sounds of leaves rustling and small instruments or voices for bird calls.</li>\n</ul><br>Example Rhythms:\n<ul>\n<li><em>The River’s Pulse</em>: Tap a drum with a slow, gentle, and steady beat.</li>\n<li><em>Forest Life:</em> Lightly shake a shaker to represent the gentle rushing of leaves and the buzzing of insects.</li>\n<li><em>Bird Calls:</em> Tap a triangle or wood block every few beats to represent the birds singing, or, use voices to mimic bird calls.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Problem: A Changing Climate</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Prompt</em>: Now, imagine the river is getting low during a long, dry season. What does it sound like? How do the people in the community feel?</li>\n<li><em>Brainstorm</em>: Students might draw cracked earth or a narrow river. They might write words like worry, empty, or quiet.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythmic Idea</em>: Guide students to think about a rhythm that feels sparse and uneasy. The steady pulse should become uneven, and the forest life sounds should diminish.</li>\n</ul><br>Example Rhythms:\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Fading River</em>: The drumbeat for the river becomes slower and more uneven.</li>\n<li><em>Empty Forest:</em> The shakers and other small instruments become silent or are used very sparingly.</li>\n<li><em>Worry:</em> Use a quiet, repetitive tapping sound to show the community’s concern.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Solution: Planting a Brighter Future</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Prompt</em>: The Sateré-Mawé people decide to take action. They plant new trees and use their traditional knowledge to protect the forest. What sounds do we hear as they work together?</li>\n<li><em>Brainstorm</em>: Students can draw people planting saplings, digging in the soil, and working as a team. They might write words like hope, strong, or together.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythmic Idea</em>: The sounds here can be purposeful and full of life. A steady, organized rhythm that mimics the sounds of planting, digging, and building fit well.</li>\n</ul><br>Example Rhythms:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Digging</em>: A steady, purposeful scrape or tapping sound on a drum or the floor.</li>\n<li><em>Planting:</em> A gentle, repeated rhythmic motion that feels like pressing a seed int the earth.</li>\n<li><em>Teamwork:</em> A strong, consistent clap or hand drum beat that everyone can follow, showing collective effort.</li>\n</ul><br><em>A Brighter Future: The Forest is Restored</em>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Prompt</em>: Thanks to their hard work, the forest is coming back to life. The river is flowing, and the animals are returning. What does this new, more hopeful forest sound like?</li>\n<li><em>Brainstorm</em>: Students might draw the sun, a full river, and a vibrant, healthy forest. They might write words like life, celebration, or future.</li>\n<li><em>Rhythmic Idea</em>: This final rhythm should be a celebration. It should combine the calm sounds from the beginning with the strong, purposeful sounds from the Planting a Brighter Future section. It should feel rich and full of life.</li>\n</ul><br>Example Rhythms:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Restored River</em>: the steady, gentle pulse of the river returns, with a fuller sound.</li>\n<li><em>Thriving Forest:</em> The shakers and bird sounds are back, but now they sound more lively and varied.</li>\n<li><em>Celebration:</em> Add fun, happy sounds with tamborines, voices, and/or other instruments. This final section should be a joyous symphony of sounds that celebrate the successful climate action.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Building on Our Musical Story"} content={"<p>**<br>`\t`Guide the students through the story on the Story Map one step at a time, using the sounds brainstormed. Remind them that they are creating a musical narrative about a real community’s resilience.\n<ul>\n<li>During the Beginning section, playing the calm rhythms together.</li>\n<li>Transition to the Problem section, making the rhythms more sparse and uneasy.</li>\n<li>Move to the Solution section, where the rhythms become more organized and purposeful.</li>\n<li>End with the Future section, where the music becomes a full, joyful celebration of their success.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Encourage students to use their boeis and faces to act out the story’s emotions as they play.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did creating the sounds for the Amazon’s story help you connect with the people and their home on a deeper level? What feelings did you have during the different parts of our musical piece?</li>\n<li>The Sateré-Mawé community worked together to solve a big problem. How did making music as a group feel like that? What does the word resilience mean in their story and in our music?</li>\n<li>We told a whole story without using a lot of words (if any at all). What did you learn about how sounds and rhythms can show emotions like worry, determinations, and hope?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about Global Goal 13 and the importance of protecting places like the Amazon? How does the story of the Sateré-Mawé people show us that everyone, even a small community, can take important action on climate change?</li>\n<li>What is one small way you can be like the Sateré-Mawé and take action to help the planet or your own community?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial story introduction, brainstorming, creation of the musical story, and engagement in the final reflection and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concepts of climate action (problems, solutions, and community) and resilience, evidenced through the intentionality of the rhythmic contributions and the clarity of verbal explanations during the discussion. Did the student’s sounds and rhythms effectively represent the problems, solutions, and community in the Amazon story?</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in creating rhythmic patterns and sounds that effectively represent the narrative elements and emotions of the story. This includes the ability to improvise with different instruments and materials to create a believable and immersive soundscape.</li>\n<li>Ability to work together as a class, listening to each other’s musical contributions, responding to cues, and collaborating cohesively to build the layered rhythmic narrative.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion. This is particularly focused on understanding the power of music and creative expression as a tool for understanding real-wrold issues and the importance of community-led solutions.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

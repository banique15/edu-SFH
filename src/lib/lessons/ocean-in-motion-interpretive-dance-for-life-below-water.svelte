	<Introduction content={"<p>Begin by introducing Global Goal 14. Explain that the ocean is like the heart of our planet; it gives us oxygetn to breathe, helps control our weather, and is home to incredible animals. But right now, the ocean needs our help because it is facing big problems.<br>Explain that our bodies are powerful tools for communication. We can use them to tell a story or show an emotion.<br>Prompt students to try some simple movements.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Show happiness with your body:</em> Students might stretch their arms wide, stand tall, or bounce.</li>\n<li><em>Show me something that is fragile:</em> Students might crouch down, make their bodies small, or move very carefully.</li>\n<li><em>Show me something that is powerful:</em> Students might stomp their feet, stand with their arms out, or make their bodies big and strong.</li>\n</ul><br>These simple prompts will help students understand that interpretive dance is about feeling and showing an idea, not learning complicated steps.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"The Ocean’s Story Brainstorm"} content={"<p>Tell the class that they will take part in a hands-on, interactive brainstorming session. Instead of just listing ideas, the class will create a story with their bodies and a few props.\n<ul>\n<li><em>A Healthy Ocean</em></li>\n<li>Start with music for a healthy ocean.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR3lp0ptpy8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ocean Waves, Beautiful Piano</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxiB4y43uN8&amp;t=4048s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Finding Nemo, Disney Music &amp; Ambience</a></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCdsa7hS7M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Watermark</a>,” Enya</li>\n<li>Ask students to move in a big, open area, giving them prompts to represent the ocean and the animals in it.</li>\n</ul><br>Prompt Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you are in the ocean itself. How would you move? Would you be a gentle wave? A deep current? What would it feel like?</li>\n<li>Imagine you are a fast-moving fish. How would you dart and weave through the water? How would you  move to show you are a slow, graceful sea turtle? How would you show you are a giant, majestic whale?</li>\n<li>Imagine a beautiful, healthy coral reef. How would you show that with your bodies? Would you stand close together? Would your movements be colorful and lively?</li>\n<li><em>The Problem</em></li>\n<li>Play music that represents threats to the ocean.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBoHX2P2Z0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dark Underwater Ambient</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIk_HY-kuSc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Ambience - Lovecraft Ocean</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc-aa5Cw9Zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dark Epic Orchestral Music - Corruption</a></li>\n<li>Place a few simple props on the floor, explaining that these objects represent pollution like tangled fishing nets or plastic. Prompt students to move in relation to the pollution.</li>\n</ul><br>Prompt Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>As you move, imagine you are a sea animal. You see a piece of pollution. How do you move to show you are trying to avoid it? How would you move to show you’ve become trapped or tangled in it? Can you show the feeling of being restricted and unab le to move freely?</li>\n<li>Encourage students to use their bodies to show struggle and panic. This can help them to feel the impact of ocean pollution.</li>\n<li>Collect the props and ask students to scatter around the space. The empty space on the floor and the quiet music will represent the problem of overfishing. Prompt students to move in relation to this issue:</li>\n</ul><br>Example Prompts:\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you are a whole school of fish, swimming together. You are safe and strong as a group. Now, imagine a net has caught your friends. What does the space around you feel like now? How do you move to show the feeling of emptiness and loss?</li>\n<li><em>Hope and Resilience</em></li>\n<li>Play inspiring music.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AfYK1fKngU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nemo Egg</a>,” Main Title from <em>Finding Nemo</em>, Thomas Newman</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C4lFUpI_4U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flying</a>,” from <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, John Powell</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOCucJw7iT8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">La Mer</a>,” Claude Debussy</li>\n<li>Prompt students to focus on movements that speak to the solutions and hope to the ocean.</li>\n</ul><br>Prompt Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you are a group of people working together to clean up a beach. How would you use your bodies to show you are strong and determined? How would you show that you are helping something grow and heal, like a coral reef?</li>\n<li>Let’s become a wave of hope. Start small, and as you move, join with others. What does a whole class of people working together look like? Can you show your shared strength and power?</li>\n</ul><br>This guided brainstorm helps students physically connect with the themes of Global Goal 14, creating a foundation of feelings and movements they can use in their own interpretive dance.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Creating Our Interpretive Dance"} content={"<p>Students will now create their own short interpretive dances in small groups. Divide the class into groups of 3-4.<br>Have each group choose a theme from the brainstorm (e.g., a healthy reef, pollution, overfishing, a cleanup effort, etc.), and create a 30-60 second dance to tell a story about that chosen theme.<br>Encourage students to use the movements that were explored in the brainstorm. Remind them to think about how their bodies can be used to show emotion. For example, instead of just standing still to show sadness, they might crouch down and make their bodies small and heavy.<br>If enough audio players are available, students can choose their own music, or, play one song for all groups to choreograph to. Give students time to create and practice their short dance.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Performance and Discussion"} content={"<p>Once the time for creating and practicing is over, all groups will perform their short dances. As each group performs, have the rest of the class watch silently and respectfully. After each performance, ask the audience to share what they saw and felt, with guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What was the story you saw? What did you think the dancers were trying to show?</li>\n<li>What emotions did you feel while watching?</li>\n<li>How did the dancers use their bodies to tell the story without using any words?</li>\n<li>How does this performance connect to Global Goal 14?</li>\n</ul><br>This part of the lesson reinforces that dance is a form of communication and that the arts can be a powerful tool for raising awareness.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did using your body to move and dance help you understand a big idea like Global Goal 14? Did it feel different from just reading about it or watching a video?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about your own body’s ability to express ideas and feelings? How can dance be a tool for sharing important messages about the ocean and inspiring others to care?</li>\n<li>The dances we created showed problems and solutions. What is one thing you can do to help protect the ocean? How did working together as a group to create a dance feel like working together to solve a big problem in the world?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, guided movement explorations, group dance creation and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Comprehension of Global Goal 14 themes (e.g., marine pollution, overfishing, the beauty of marine life), as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in movement and verbal explanations during discussions.</li>\n<li>Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract concepts related to ocean health into physical movement. This can be evidenced in the unique ways bodies were used to show an emotion or problem.</li>\n<li>How clearly and powerfully the movements communicated an understanding of Global Goal 14. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion in the audience?</li>\n<li>Ability to work together as a group, listening to other’s ideas, collaborating on the choreography, and performing respectfully for classmates.</li>\n<li>Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life below water.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use the power of music to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 8 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has a good job \\- one that is fair, safe, and where they are treated with respect. Emphasize that it’s also about helping communities and countries grow stronger in a way that helps everyone and doesn’t harm our planet. Explain this means jobs that are safe, pay fairly, and help the world be a better place.<br>Explain to students that just like a symphony has many different instruments and sounds working together, the world of work has many different jobs and people, all contributing. Clarify that music can help us understand how all these parts work together for a better world.</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Guess the Work Sound"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will use their voice, body percussion, or an instrument to create a sound or short rhythm that represents a common job or work activity. Instruct students to listen carefully, try to imitate the sound/rhythm quietly, and then guess what job it might be.<br><em>Teacher Plays, Students Guess</em><br><em> Perform a rhythmic sound for a job using your voice, body percussion, or a simple instrument.<br>Examples of Rhythms/Sounds and Jobs<br></em> <em>Hammering:</em> tap-tap-tap-BANG\\!

	<CustomSection title={"Exploring Musical Concepts for Work"} content={"<p>Explain that music has special ingredients that help tell a story or show feelings about jobs and growth. The class will experiment with these concepts using their instruments and voices.<br><em> </em>Rhythm and Dynamics:<em> Rhythm is the pattern of sounds (like a heartbeat or a drumbeat), and dynamics refers to how loud or soft the music is.<br></em> Ask: How would a fast, steady rhythm with loud dynamics show a busy factory or a quick, strong worker?<br><em> E.g., tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap quickly and loudly on a drum, or rapid claps.<br></em> Ask: How would a slow, uneven rhythm with soft dynamics show a tired worker or a job that feels a bit difficult?<br><em> E.g., STOMP…quiet tap…STOMP slowly ans softly, or a slow, sighing hum.<br></em> <em>Melody and Harmony:</em> Melody is the tune (the part you might hum), and harmony is when different notes or voices sound good together.<br><em> Ask: How would a simple, happy melody (high or low) show a job that feels fair and good?<br></em> E.g., a simple rising hum like do-re-mi, or a cheerful la-la-la<br><em> Ask: How could different voices or instruments playing simple sounds together show teamwork and how everyone contributes to a job?<br></em> E.g., one group hums a low note, another a high note, blending them together.<br><em> Have students explore simple melodies and layering sounds.<br></em> <em>Form and Structure:</em> Form is how a piece of music is organized into different sections, like a song having a verse and a chorus.<br><em> Ask: How could you use two different musical sections to show a problem at work and then a solution?<br></em> E.g., an “A” part that’s messy and then a “B” part that’s organized.<br><em> Have students try moving from one contrasting musical idea to another.<br></em> E.g., chaotic banging followed by a calm, steady beat.<br><em> </em>Timbre (Instrument Sounds):<em> Timbre is the unique sound quality of an instrument or voice (what makes a drum sound different from a shaker, or your voice different from a robot’s).<br></em> Ask: What instrument sounds like hard, strong work?<br><em> E.g., a drum, a rhythm stick.<br></em> Ask: What sounds like something new and exciting being invented?<br><em> E.g., a shaker, a bell, a unique vocal sound.<br></em> Ask: What kind of vocal sound would represent a specific feeling about work?<br><em> E.g., hum, cheer, sigh, whisper.<br></em> Have students explore different instrument/vocal sounds.<br>Guide students to explore with their instruments and voices to demonstrate how these different musical elements can tell a story about work and economic growth. This serves as an integrated brainstorming process.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Music and Global Goal 8"} content={"<p>Explain that music can tell powerful stories about work and economic growth. The class will listen to one or two age-appropriate songs (or look at their lyrics, or both) that connect to Global Goal 8\\.<br>Song Examples:<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG2zyeVRcbs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Climb”</a> by Miley Cyrus<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1b8AhIsSYQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“We Built This City”</a> by Starship<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)”</a> by Kelly Clarkson<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbxUSsFXYo4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“9 to 5”</a> by Dolly Parton<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve-mANenpC4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Working Class Hero”</a> by John Lennon<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O445CcK0qY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Working in the Coal Mine”</a> by DEVO<br>Play the chosen song(s). Guide students to analyze not just the lyrics but also the musical elements of the song and how they contribute to the overall message. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> What emotions or thoughts did this song make you feel? How did the music (like the beat, the loudness, the instruments) make you feel that way?<br></em> How does the rhythm of the song make you think about work or effort? (e.g., Is it fast like a busy day? Slow like careful work? Steady like teamwork?).<br><em> What do you notice about the loudness and softness (dynamics) in the song? Where does it get louder or softer, and what feeling does that give you about the story?<br></em> Do you hear different instrument sounds? How do they help tell the story or show the feelings about work?<br><em> How does the melody (the tune) of the song make you feel about the message of hard work or teamwork? (e.g., is it happy and bouncy? Strong and determined? Calm and gentle?).<br></em> What specific lyrics (if present and appropriate) stand out to you about jobs, fairness, or growing stronger?<br><em> Does this song connect to your own experiences or observations about the world of work or building things?<br></em> Does this song make you feel like everyone has a chance to do good work?\n<ul>\n<li>Does this song show the importance of teamwork or trying hard?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Mini-Musical Statements"} content={"<p>Have students break into pairs or small groups (3-4 students).

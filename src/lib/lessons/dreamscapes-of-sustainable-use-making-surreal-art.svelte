	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an exciting art class. Explain that they will use their imaginations and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 12 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to be smarter about the things we use and make. Emphasize that this means:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Being mindful:</em> Thinking about what we buy and if we really need it.</li>\n<li><em>Reducing waste:</em> Using less, and throwing away less.</li>\n<li><em>Reusing and recycling:</em> Finding new lives for old things.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`It’s about making things in a way that’s good for the planet and making sure we don’t use up all our planet’s resources, so there’s enough for a long time.<br>`\t`Introduce the art style of Surrealism. Explain that Surrealist art is like art from a dream. It shows things that are illogical, silly, or strange, often by putting everyday objects in weird places or transforming them into something else. Clarify that Surrealist artists wanted to make people think differently about the world by showing it in a bizarre and unexpected way.<br>`\t`Show selected Surrealist artworks.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-elephants-large\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Elephants</em></a><em>,</em> Salvador Dali</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1931\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Persistence of Memory</em></a><em>,</em> Salvador Dali</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte/son-of-man-1964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Son of Man</em></a><em>,</em> Rene Magritte</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte/gonconda-1953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Golconda</em></a><em>,</em> Rene Magritte</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/meret-oppenheim/object-le-d-jeuner-en-fourrure-1936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)</em></a><em>,</em> Meret Oppenheim</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/the-tilled-field-1924\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Tilled Field</em></a><em>,</em> Joan Miro</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/joan-miro/the-farm-1922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Farm</em></a><em>,</em> Joan Miro</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Facilitate a discussion about the art, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What do you notice about these paintings? Do they look like real life?</li>\n<li>What is so strange or funny about this artwork?</li>\n<li>How does this artwork make you feel? Do you feel curious, silly, or a little bit confused?</li>\n<li>How do you think Surrrealist art, with its strange combinations, could help us think abot things we use every day, like old plastic bottles or paper?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Dream Object Doodle"} content={"<p>`\t`Ensure all students have a piece of scrap paper and a writing utensil.<br>`\t`<em>Your Favorite Object</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students close their eyes gently if comfortable, and imagine one of their favorite everyday objects. This could be a hairbrush, video game controller, book, or snack they love, etc.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Dream Transformation</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, have students imagine that object exists in a dream world, and morphs into something different, yet still recognizable in that dream world. Have students think of a weird, funny, and/or strange way their object can exist in this world.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions like:</li>\n<li>What does your object turn into?</li>\n<li>Does your brush turn into a snake?</li>\n<li>Does your controller turn into a rocket ship?</li>\n<li>Does your snack turn into paper and fold?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The Doodle</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students open their eyes and draw a quick doodle of the dream transformation onto their paper. Clarify that perfection is not the goal, they should draw quickly so they can remember their idea.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Have a few students quickly share their Dream Object Doodles.<br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming the imaginative thinking, explaining that these weird and wonderful transformations are a key to Surrealist art.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Exploring Surrealist Techniques"} content={"<p>**<br>`\t`Ensure all students have paper and access to art supplies.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Consumption Transformation Grid"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain to the class that they will brainstorm ideas for their Surralist art by thinking of everyday items, then imagining what they could transform into to help the planet.<br>`\t`Ensure all students have a medium-large piece of paper, and instruct them to fold it to create a grid of 6-8 squares.<br>`\t`<em>The Before Item</em>\n<ul>\n<li>In each square, have students draw a simple sketch of a common household item or a piece of trash (e.g., a plastic bottle, an old shoe, a cardboard box, a used paper bag, a bottle cap, a plastic straw).</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>The After Transformation</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, instruct students to think about how they could use a Surrealist technique to transform it into something else, or show its journey.</li>\n<li>Examples:</li>\n<li>A plastic bottle → a fish swimming in the sea.</li>\n<li>A cardboard box → a tree.</li>\n<li>An old shoe → a tiny home for a bug.</li>\n<li>A bottle cap → a giant button on a robot.</li>\n<li>A soda can → a flower.</li>\n<li>A plastic fork → a flock of birds.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions to help spark ideas while students are thinking about how to transform their item:</li>\n<li>What could this old shoe transform into if it was a happy, new thing?</li>\n<li>What could this plastic bottle turn into in a dream?</li>\n<li>What if you combined this item with something from nature?</li>\n<li>What if this object had a feeling? What would a sad, used-up bottle look like? Or a happy recycled container?</li>\n<li>How could you make this object’s size the opposite of what it should be?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Instruct students to draw the after transformation next to the before item in the same square. This brainstorm creates a visual plan for their Surrealist art.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Dream of Waste and Wonders"} content={"<p>`\t`Ensure each student has a large piece of paper/cardstock and access to art materials.<br>`\t`Explain that they will create their own Surrealist artwork about Global Goal 12, using the ideas from their Consumption Transformation Grid and the Surrealist techniques they learned. Clarify that their art should tell a story or show a feeling about what we use, what we throw away, and what we can do to be more mindful.<br>`\t`Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Combine Ideas:</em> Use a collage of magazine cutouts with the drawings.</li>\n<li><em>Use a Surrealist Trick:</em> use juxtaposition, transformation, or scale distortion to make the art strange, funny, or thought-provoking.</li>\n<li><em>Tell a Story:</em> Does the art show a problem with waste, or a happy solution?</li>\n<li><em>Be Creative:</em> Make sure students aren’t focused on making their art look completely real.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Circulate, offering encouragement and guidance, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How are you using juxtaposition to show the difference between what we use and what we throw away?</li>\n<li>Can you make a tiny piece of plastic look like a giant to show a big problem?</li>\n<li>What colors will you use to show a happy, recycled world? What about a confused, wasteful world?</li>\n<li>How can your art show a dream about a world with less trash?</li>\n<li>What message about responsible consumption do you want your art to send?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Presentation and Discussion"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that students will now share their art. This can be done through volunteer presentation or by having students work in pairs.<br>`\t`Facilitate a discussion about the artworks after sharing, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some of the most strange or unexpected parts of the artworks you saw? What made them so interesting?</li>\n<li>How did the artists use Surrealist techniques (e.g., changing th size of things, putting objects in weird places, etc.) to show their message?</li>\n<li>What are some of the common themes (e.g., recycling, pollution, new inventions from trash, nature taking over, etc.) you noticed in the art?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about responsible consumption and production by seeing these artworks?</li>\n<li>What message about Global Goal 12 do you think the artworks would convey to others?</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude the discussion by affirming their artistic choices and abilities to show big ideas with art.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did exploring Surrealism, with its focus on illogical and dreamlike ideas, help you express your thoughts and feelings about responsible consumption and production?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of art that challenges conventional ways of thinking to help us think differently about waste and sustainability?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the urgency of addressing unsustainable consumption and production patterns through this artistic exploration?</li>\n<li>How did framing issues through a dreamscape or silly lens help to reveal the importance of some of the problems or solutions?</li>\n<li>What is one key takeaway about responsible consumption and the role of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Conssitent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, individual art creation, and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of responsible consumption and production (reducing waste, reusing, recycling), as demonstrated through the symbolism and message in the Surrealist artwork and the verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effort in creating the final art piece. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 12 (does the artwork clearly represent ideas related to consumption, waste, or sustainability from the brainstorm?), and use of surrealist techniques (are there attempts to use juxtaposition, transformation, or scale distortion to convey the message?).</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea \\- Global Goal 4: Quality Education.<br><em> Emphasize that this means ensuring everyone, everywhere, has a chance to get a great education by going to good schools, learning important and interesting things, and getting ready for the future, from little kids to grown-ups.<br></em> It's about ensuring that learning is for all people, no matter who they are, where they live, or what they need to help them learn best.<br>Explain that dance and movement are powerful tools to show big ideas, feelings, and stories without even using words.\n<ul>\n<li>Today, the class will use movement to explore what learning feels like, what makes it easy or hard, and how we can make sure everyone gets a great education.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: The Learning Machine"} content={"<p>Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students.<br>Instruct each group to stand in a loose formation, facing each other.<br>Explain that one person will start by making a simple, repetitive movement and a quiet sound (e.g., softly clapping their hands). Clarify that this is the first \"part\" of their Learning Machine.<br>Instruct the next person to add their own movement, linking it to the first person's actions, as if they are a connected \"gear\" in the machine (e.g., softly tapping their foot in time with the clap).<br>Guide them to continue this, with each student adding their own unique, repetitive movement, linking to the person before them, until everyone in the group is part of the \"machine,\" creating a chain of interconnected movements.<br>Encourage groups to add more complexity to their machine (if needed) by introducing variations in rhythm or tempo, changing the volume or intensity of their movements, incorporating different levels (high, medium, low), and adding simple gestures or facial expressions to enhance their performance.<br>Emphasize the importance of listening and responding to each other's cues. Encourage them to experiment with different ways of connecting their movements and sounds to create a cohesive and dynamic machine.<br><em>Phase 1: Smooth Functioning</em><br><em> Once the basic machine is established, guide groups to explore different ways of expressing its smooth functioning. They can increase the speed and intensity of their movements and sounds, conveying a sense of efficiency and productivity. Encourage them to smile, nod, or make eye contact with each other to show cooperation and enjoyment.<br></em> They can gradually add more complex movements and rhythms, demonstrating the machine's capacity for growth and adaptation.<br><em>Phase 2: The Breakdown and Repair</em><br><em> Introduce a challenge by having one person in each group \"break down\" or make a small, purposeful mistake in their movement.<br></em> Explain that the rest of the group must react and adapt, showing frustration or confusion through their movements. Encourage them to use exaggerated gestures and facial expressions to express their emotions.<br><em> After a brief period of breakdown, guide the groups to \"repair\" the machine and resume its smooth functioning. Suggest they slow down and carefully re-establish the rhythm and coordination, offering helping gestures to the person who \"broke down,\" and gradually building back up to a faster tempo and more complex movements.<br></em> Encourage expressing joy and relief through smiles, laughter, and celebratory movements.<br>Once finished, open the floor for a brief discussion about the connection between the machine activity and the learning process. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> How was working together in your Learning Machine like working together in a classroom or on a team project?<br></em> What happened when one part of the machine broke down? How is that like hitting a tricky spot in learning, or someone needing help?\n<ul>\n<li>How did your group fix the machine? How is that like helping a friend learn, or finding a new way to understand something?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Our Learning Stories in Motion"} content={"<p>Explain that you will brainstorm as a class, thinking about all the amazing things that help us learn and get a good education, and also the things that can sometimes block our way.<br>On the whiteboard/paper, draw a large, winding pathway or road. At the start of the path, write \"Learning Journey.\"<br><em> </em>Along the Path (Positive Elements)<em><br></em> Ask: What are some things that make learning awesome and easy? What helps you get a good education?<br><em> Examples: Good teachers, interesting books, cool classrooms, kind friends, computers/tech, exciting field trips, playtime, quiet study spots, healthy food, a comfortable desk, sunshine, fresh air, a library, happy feelings, trying new things, asking questions, getting help.<br></em> Write these ideas along the path using one color marker (e.g., blue).<br><em> </em>Blocking the Path (Challenges)<em><br></em> Ask; What are some things that can sometimes make learning hard, or stop someone from getting a good education?<br><em> Examples: No books, a noisy classroom, feeling sad or worried, no pens/pencils, a broken desk, feeling left out, no school nearby, not having a teacher, feeling tired, being sick, not understanding, feeling confused, bullying, being hungry.<br></em> Write these ideas blocking the path using a different color marker (e.g., red).<br>Reflect on the visual and summarize that this pathway to learning shows how many things help us learn, and also what challenges people might face. These great ideas will be used for the next activity.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Learning Journey Scenes"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups (3-5 students), can be the same groups as the first activity or different.<br>Explain that each group will create ttwo short movement scenes (about 30-45 seconds each) that tell a story about Global Goal 4: Quality Education.<br>The scenes should be silent dances or movement sequences, using only their bodies, faces, and perhaps simple props (if available).<br><em> </em>Scene 1: The Blocked Path:<em> This scene/dance will show a challenge or obstacle to learning, inspired by the Blocking the Path ideas from the brainstorm.<br></em> <em>Scene 2: The Clear Path:</em> This scene/dance will show how that challenge is overcome, or how students are learning happily and successfully, inspired by the Along the Path ideas.<br>Encourage groups to think about:<br><em> </em>Characters:<em> Who are the people in their dance scene? (e.g., a student trying to learn, a teacher, a group of friends).<br></em> <em>Body Language and Facial Expressions:</em> How can they use their bodies and faces to show the problem (frustration, sadness, confusion) and the solution (joy, understanding, collaboration) clearly without words)?<br><em> </em>Action:<em> What simple actions can they use to show the challenge and then the solution? (e.g., dancing to tell a story, as if searching for a book, trying to read but being confused, helping a friend, reaching for a high shelf, building with blocks).<br></em> <em>Space and Levels:</em> Can they use high/low levels to show different feelings (e.g., slumped low for frustration, jumping high for excitement)?<br><em> </em>Teamwork:<em> How does everyone in the group contribute to both dance scenes?<br></em> <em>Props (Optional):</em> If available, can they use any simple classroom props symbolically?<br>Circulate among groups, offering guidance and encouraging creativity. Ask guiding questions like:<br><em> What specific challenge from our brainstorm are you showing in your first dance scene? How does your body show that feeling?<br></em> How does your second dance scene show learning happening happily? What actions are they doing?<br><em> How does your group show that students are helping each other?<br></em> Can you use a big movement to show a moment of \"aha\\!\" or understanding?\n<ul>\n<li>Are you thinking about the transition from the blocked dance scene to the clear dance scene?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Our Learning Journey Dance Scenes"} content={"<p>Gather the class to watch each group's dance scenes. Remind the audience to be respectful and silent, focusing on the story and feelings being told with the movements.<br>Have each group perform their Dance Scene 1 (The Blocked Path) silently, holding the final pose for a few seconds.<br>Then, have them immediately transition to their Dance Scene 2 (The Clear Path) silently, holding the final post for a few seconds.<br>After both scenes, invite the audience into a discussion. Ask gudiding questions like:<br><em> What challenge to learning did you see in Dance Scene 1? What did their bodies show?<br></em> What solution or positive learning did you see in Dance Scene 2? How did the feelings change?\n<ul>\n<li>How did the two scenes tell a story about getting a good education, without using words?</li>\n</ul><br>After all groups have performed and discussions have been had, invite all performing groups to briefly explain their intended message: \"Our scenes shows \\[challenge\\] and how \\[solution\\] helps with quality education for all.\"</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<ReflectionQuestions questions={["How did using our bodies to move and create dance scenes help you understand Global Goal 4: Quality Education in a different way?","What did you learn about the importance of schools being safe, welcoming, and fun places to learn for everyone?","Which scenes or ideas from your classmates made you think, \"Wow, that's a great idea for learning\\!\" and why?","What does this lesson tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 4?","What's one small thing you can do this week to make your own classroom or school a more helpful, welcoming, or fun place to learn?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<AssessmentCriteria criteria={["Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, brainstorm, group dance scene creation, and active participation in class discussions (both performing and observing).","Understanding of the core concept of quality education for all, including aspects of safety, inclusivity, and effective learning environments, as demonstrated through movement choices, scenes, and verbal explanations.","Originality and effectiveness in using bodies to convey emotions and ideas related to both the challenges and solutions for quality education. Look for clear effort in expressing feelings and concepts without words.","Ability to work effectively within the small groups during the dance scene creation, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively.","Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion."]} {sdgColor} />

Connect this to Target 4.a by explaining this means a school where:<br></em> You feel totally safe and secure, like no one will bully you.<br><em> Everyone feels welcome and included, no matter who they are or what they need.<br></em> The classrooms and spaces make learning exciting and fun.\n<ul>\n<li>Every student feels comfortable and ready to learn.</li>\n</ul><br>Tell them that tooday, the class will be looking to the future, designing our very own School of Tomorrow, a school that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive for all learners."} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Dream School Feature Flash"} content={"<p>Begin with a quick imagination-sparking warm-up to get brains ready.<br><em> Instruct students that when you say \"Go\\!\", they should quickly think of one exciting thing they would want in their School of Tomorrow that makes it safe, welcoming, or fun for learning. This can be realistic, futuristic, or completely made up. Encourage them to use their imaginations. They can draw a quick picture on their paper or just think or whisper the idea to themselves.<br>Make sure students know these can be realistic, or something fantastical, have them use their imaginations.<br>Continue this for a few rounds. Examples:<br></em> <em>Round 1, Safety:</em> What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make it feel super safe? Go\\!<br><em> E.g., Force fields around the school, quiet zones for focusing, anti-bullying robots, soft landing floors, comfortable seating, calm-down corners, sensors that detect sadness, doors that know who belong, safe play areas, bright lights at night, friendly crossing guards who are always there.<br></em> <em>Round 2, Welcoming:</em> What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make it feel welcoming and inclusive for everyone/ Go\\!<br><em> E.g., rainbow hallways, comfy beanbag chairs, a kindness robot, a buddy bench, rooms with different light/sound levels, personalized lockers, quiet study spots, community spaces, signs in many languages, diverse art on walls, ramps for wheelchairs, sensory spaces, places to rest quietly, big smiles at the door.<br></em> <em>Round 3, Learning Feature:</em> What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make learning fun and engaging for everyone? Go\\!\n<ul>\n<li>E.g., Hologram teachers, outdoor adventure classrooms, flying desks, robots that help with homework, immersive VR learning, art studios everywhere, edible gardens, a giant slide in every classroom, a science lab that smells like cookies, rooms that change color/temperature to help you focus, a music room where instruments float, discovery zones.</li>\n</ul><br>After each round, invite a few students to quickly share their ideas.

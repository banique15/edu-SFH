	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 5, Gender Equality, which aims to make sure everyone: boys, girls, men and women, have fair and equal chances in life. You emphasize that this means everyone gets to be treated with respect, has the same opportunities to learn and grow, and can feel strong and proud of who they are, no matter their gender. Explain that it’s all about being fair to all.<br>Explain to students that words have power. Clarify that in stories, plays, and even in real life, the way characters talk to each other (their dialogue) can show big feelings, solve problems, and even change minds. Dialogue can reveal what characters care about, help them stand up for what’s right, and show how they support each other.<br>Tell students that today, they will all become scriptwriters, crafting their own short scenes where characters talk about fairness and equality, showing how words can spark change.<br>[Optional] You can show video clips of dialogue from age-appropriate TV shows or movies that demonstrate characters speaking up for fairness, challenging stereotypes, or supporting each other.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtoDmIelT0I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steven Universe, Stronger Than You</a> (focus on strength and individuality).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e06cIX_ah4U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avatar: The Last Airbender, Toph join Team Avatar</a> (focus on challenging expectations about what girls can do).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ViOvIS1LP0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Avatar: The Last Airbender, Katara vs. Pakku</a> (focus on challenging traditional gender roles).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3la1k8ruLEg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Owl House: Amity Protects Luz from her Parents</a> (focus on characters pursuing their interests against expectations, or standing up for what’s right, even if it’s hard).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkY2s-lpf6M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power: Best Friend Squad</a> (focus on female characters being strong leaders, valuing different kinds of strength, and supporting each other against challenges).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzeTQOtggLE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turning Red: Mei Tries to Let Go</a> (focus on characters embracing who they are, managing big emotions, and the support of friends and family).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjE5aGKFhQ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brave: Archery Scene</a> (focus on challenging gender norms and being proud of your talents).</li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a brief discussion about the clips or the power of words in general. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did the characters in this/these clip(s) use their words to show what they were feeling?</li>\n<li>Did any characters speak up for themselves or someone else? How did that feel to watch?</li>\n<li>How did the characters’ words help solve a problem or show fairness?</li>\n<li>What kind of power do words have when people use them to talk about what’s fair or unfair?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Word Connection"} content={"<p>Explain that the students will play a word connection game. Tell students that you will say a word related to fairness or equality, and the next person will then say the first word (a new word) that comes to their mind when they hear it, building a chain of ideas.<br>Example:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Teacher Starts:</em> Fairness!</li>\n<li><em>Possible Student Responses (Example Chain):</em> Kindness → Sharing → Equal → Respect → Listen → Strong → Voice → Brave → Opportunity → Grow → Teamwork → Happy → Smile → Friends → Play → Learn → Dream → Future → Together → Help → Support → Different → Unique → Honest → Truth → Justice → Right → Peace → Joy → Celebrate</li>\n</ul><br>Encourage quick thinking and emphasize that any word that connects is great. The goal is to get ideas flowing and build vocabulary around the theme.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Crafting Equality Conversations"} content={"<p>Explain: We’re going to create some scenarios that will be the sparks for your scripts. We’ll think about everyday situations where fairness might be needed, or where people show how strong and equal they are.<br>On the whiteboard, draw two columns: Everyday Fairness Challenges and Showing Strength and Equality.<br><em>Everyday Fairness Challenges</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students: Think about times when things might now feel fair or equal, maybe at school, at home, or during a game. What are some small situations where someone might feel left out, or like they don’t have the same chance?</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Someone says “girls can’t play that sport”</li>\n<li>A kid gets teased for liking a gendered toy</li>\n<li>Chores aren’t shared fairly at home</li>\n<li>Someone says “boys don’t cry”</li>\n<li>A friend is chosen last for a team</li>\n<li>Someone is told they can’t be a leader because of their gender</li>\n<li>A group ignores someone’s idea because of their gender.</li>\n<li>Write these situations under Everyday Fairness Challenges.</li>\n</ul><br><em>Showing Strength and Equality (Solutions)</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask: How can characters show strength, fairness, and equality in these situations, or in any situation? What words or actions would they use to make things fair or to lift someone up?</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Someone says “everyone gets a turn!”</li>\n<li>A character shares their toys/supplies</li>\n<li>A friend invites someone who is left out</li>\n<li>Someone says “It’s okay to cry”</li>\n<li>A group listens to everyone’s ideas</li>\n<li>Someone stands up for a friend being teased</li>\n<li>A character shows a new skill that surprises others</li>\n<li>Two characters share chores</li>\n<li>A character compliments someone’s unique talent</li>\n<li>Write these ideas under Showing Strength and Equality (Solutions).</li>\n</ul><br>Summarize that these scenarios and ideas for speaking up are perfect for the students’ upcoming scripts.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Character Pairs: Everyday Fairness"} content={"<p>Have students break into pairs (or groups of three if necessary and include narrator/third character), and choose (or be assigned) one Everyday Fairness Challenge OR Showing Strength and Equality idea from the brainstormed lists.<br>Instruct each pair/group to quickly brainstorm the characters for their scene. These characters should have different viewpoints or roles.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>A friend who feels left out of a game because of their gender, and another friend who invites them to play.</li>\n<li>A classmate who says “Boys don’t cry” and another classmate who calmly says “It’s okay to cry, feelings are for everyone.”</li>\n<li>Two friends trying to decide who gets to lead a project fairly, and a third friend who suggests a fair way to choose.</li>\n<li>A student with a great idea in class, and another student who accidentally interrupts or tries to ignore them; the first student then calmly speaks up to share their idea.</li>\n<li>An older sibling who says a game is “only for boys,” and a younger sibling or parent character who insists everyone gets to play.</li>\n<li>A character who thinks only one gender does chores, and another character who suggests sharing all chores equally.</li>\n<li>A group of two friends, and a new student who feels shy because they don’t know anyone; one of the original friends makes them feel welcome.</li>\n<li>A character who thinks someone can’t be good at something (like building or singing) because of their gender, and another character who shows how talented their are, proving them wrong.</li>\n</ul><br>Encourage students to give their characters simple names and think about how they might feel.<br>Circulate, offering guidance.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Scriptwriting: Speaking Up for Fairness"} content={"<p>Instruct students to begin crafting a short script (about ½ - 1 page long) featuring a conversation between their two or three characters based on their chosen scenario.<br>Instruct them to focus on dialogue that shows:\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Challenge:</em> How the unfair solution or stereotype is revealed in the conversation.</li>\n<li><em>The Change/Solution:</em> How the characters talk about it, challenge the unfairness, or show support to make things more fair.</li>\n<li><em>Feelings:</em> How the dialogue shows what the characters are feeling (e.g., frustration, sadness, bravery, happiness).</li>\n</ul><br>Provide writing prompts or sentence starters if needed:\n<ul>\n<li>Why do you always say that?</li>\n<li>But I think everyone should get a turn.</li>\n<li>That’s not fair because…</li>\n<li>What if we tried…?</li>\n<li>I heard you say…and that didn’t feel fair.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl, you can still…</li>\n<li>Thank you for listening.</li>\n<li>I feel strong when…</li>\n<li>We can share this equally.</li>\n</ul><br>Encourage students to use strong verbs and words that show emotion. Circulate the room, offering support and guidance as they write. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can your characters’ words show they are feeling frustrated?</li>\n<li>What would the other character say to make things fair?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Performance and Peer Feedback"} content={"<p>Have each pair/group perform their script for the class (they can fully act or table read).<br>After each script is performed, encourage peers to provide kind and helpful feedback, focusing on:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Clear Message:</em> Did the conversation make it clear what the characters were struggling with regarding fairness, or what solution they found? What was the main message about gender equality?</li>\n<li><em>Character Voice:</em> Did the characters’ words sound like real people? Did you believe what they were saying or how they were feeling?</li>\n<li><em>Impact:</em> How did this scene make you feel? Did it make you think differently about fairness or how you could speak up?</li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a brief discussion, asking for volunteers to share. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What common ideas about fairness or speaking up did you hear across the different scenes?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about how our words can help make things fair for everyone?</li>\n<li>Did any specific line or moment of dialogue from a scene stand out to you as particularly powerful? Why?</li>\n<li>How did hearing the conversations play out make the ideas about gender equality feel more real?</li>\n<li>What kind of spark did these scenes create in your mind about how you can use your words?</li>\n<li>Did any scene remind you of something you’ve seen or heard in your own life related to fairness or gender equality?</li>\n<li>What’s one new way you might try to use your words to be fair or supportive after this lesson?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did writing dialogue help you explore what fairness and equality mean for everyone?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of words to show feelings, solve problems, and help make things fair?</li>\n<li>Which scenes or ideas from your classmates made you think or feel the most about gender equality, and why?</li>\n<li>What did this activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 5: Gender Equality?</li>\n<li>What’s one small word or action you feel inspired to use this week to promote fairness and respect in your school or home?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, scriptwriting, and class discussions (both performing and listening).</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of gender equality (fairness, equal opportunities, respect for all genders), as demonstrated through the content and message of the scripts and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effort in crafting the short scripts. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 5 (does the dialogue clearly explore a situation related to fairness, equality, or challenging stereotypes?), dialogue quality (does the dialogue sound natural for the characters and show their feelings?), and problem/solution arc (does the dialogue show a challenge and then how it is addressed or solved?).</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the pairs/groups, brainstorming ideas, crafting dialogue, and performing respectfully.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

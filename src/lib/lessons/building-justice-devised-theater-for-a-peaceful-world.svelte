What words might express the shift from tension to calm?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.2</strong> <em>(End Abuse):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the image of a broken bird’s wing. Find a posture that feels restricted or wounded. How might you move with this limitation? What sounds of pain, frustration, or longing might you make? What single word might capture this feeling?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.3</strong> <em>(Rule of Law):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the sound of a gavel striking. Find a still, upright posture. Then, with  a sharp, clear movement and sound (clap, stomp, vocalization), represent the gavel. What feeling does this action evoke? What words might signify order, judgement, or fairness?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.4</strong> <em>(Illicit Flows):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore a dark, winding river.

What words might express being stuck or manipulated?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.6</strong> <em>(Accountable Institutions):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the feeling of a building with strong foundations.

What simple word could be a foundation?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.7</strong> <em>(Inclusive Decision Making):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore a circle of people all facing inwards. Move as if you are offering a movement or sound to the center. Then, respond to what others offer. What sounds or phrases might represent your contribution or your response to others?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.8</strong> <em>(Global Governance):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore different musical instruments playing together. Each person choose a simple sound or movement rhythm. Then, try to layer these together, listening and responding to create a collective harmony or dissonance. What words or sounds might represent agreement or disagreement?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.9</strong> <em>(Legal Identity):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the action of someone being recognized or seen clearly.

What sounds or words might represent the revealing of truth or access to knowledge?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.a</strong> <em>(Strengthen Institutions):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the action of tying a knot to make something stronger. Use your body to show something weak or unstable. Then, with focused movements, show the act of reinforcing or connecting. What sounds or short phrases might represent building strength or providing support?</li>\n<li><strong>Target 16.b</strong> <em>(Non-Discrimination):</em></li>\n<li>Let’s explore the action of separating and then coming together equally. Start with distinct, separate movements or sounds. The, gradually blend them, finding moments of harmony or shared rhythm.

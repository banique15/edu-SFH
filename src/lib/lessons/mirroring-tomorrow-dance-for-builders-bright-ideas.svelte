Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 9, Industry, Innovation, and infrastructure.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 9 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to help communities and countries build strong, lasting things (like safe roads, schools, and hospitals) \\- that’s infrastructure. Emphasize it’s also about new ideas and inventions that make life better \\- that’s innovation. And it’s about making sure industries (where things are made) are fair and sustainable, helping everyone grow \\- that’s industry. Basically, it’s about building a better, smarter world for everyone.<br>Introduce the concept of mirroring. Explain that mirroring in movement and dance is when two or more people move in sync with each other, reflecting each other’s movements just like a mirror. Clarify that it requires focusing on your partner, observing closely, and communicating without words. Tell students that mirroring helps build trust and understanding, and it’s a great way to show how different ideas or people can work together to build something amazing."} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Haiku Exploration"} content={"<p>Explain the form; define haiku poetry, emphasizing its 5-7-5 syllable structure and its origins in Japanese literature. Explain how haiku traditionally focuses on nature but can be adapted to explore other themes.<br>Haiku poetry is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that is renowned for its brevity and elegance. It's a three-line poem with a strict syllable count: 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third. This 5-7-5 structure creates a concise and focused expression, often capturing a moment or observation.<br>Haiku originated in Japan centuries ago, evolving from a collaborative linked-verse form called <em>renga</em>. The opening stanza of a renga was called a <em>hokku</em>, which eventually developed into the standalone haiku we know today.<br>While haiku traditionally focuses on nature and the changing seasons, modern haiku poets often explore a wider range of subjects, including emotions, social issues, and even abstract concepts. The essence of haiku lies in its ability to convey a deep meaning or feeling within its compact form.<br><em>Model Haiku</em>: Present some haiku examples related to Global Goal 8's targets.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.1</strong> </em>(Sustain per captia economic growth):<em> Growth lifts the nation, Income rises year by year, Lives are improved now.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.2</strong> <em>(Achieve higher levels of economic productivity):</em> New tech skills advance, Output soars efficiency, Prosperity blooms.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.3</strong> </em>(Promote development-oriented policies):<em> Small loans big impact, Entrepreneurs take the lead, Jobs and wealth expand.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.4</strong> <em>(Improve global resource efficiency):</em> Less waste more reuse, Green growth planet thrives with jobs, Sustainable path.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.5</strong> </em>(Achieve full and productive employment):<em> Equal pay for work, Opportunities for all souls, No one left behind.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.6</strong> <em>(Substantially reduce youth unemployment):</em> Youth trained skills honed, Ready for the workforce now, Futures bright and bold.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.7</strong> </em>(Eradicate forced labor and child labor):<em> No child in the mines, Education sets them free, Childhood protected.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.8</strong> <em>(Protect labor rights):</em> Safe work fair treatment, Workers' rights defended strong, Dignity for all.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.9</strong> </em>(Promote sustainable tourism):<em> Travelers explore, Local cultures shared with pride, Jobs and growth take root.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.10</strong> <em>(Strengthen domestic financial institutions):</em> Banks open doors wide, Access for all to build wealth, Financial freedom.<br><em> <strong>Target 8.a</strong> </em>(Increase aid for trade support):<em> Trade boosts economies, Partnerships for shared progress, Aid helps nations rise.<br></em> <strong>Target 8.b</strong> <em>(Develop a global strategy for youth employment):</em> Global goals unite, Youth employment a priority, Invest in the future.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Connecting Haiku to Global Goal 8"} content={"<p>Divide students into small groups.<br>Assign each group a specific target from Global Goal 8 (or allow them to choose on that interests them). Have the group discuss the target, focusing on what it means in practical terms.<br>Ask open-ended questions to stimulate discussion.<br><em> Why do you think this target is important?<br></em> What are some of the challenges in achieving this target?<br><em> How  might this target affect people in different parts of the world?<br></em> What can we do to contribute to this target?<br>Facilitate collaborative learning by encouraging students to share their ideas and perspectives within their groups.<br>Guide each student to write at least two haiku poems inspired by their group's target (ensure each haiku is on its own piece of paper). Encourage them to use vivid language and imagery to capture the essence of the target.<br>To help students craft meaningful haiku, you can offer guidance if needed, including the following:<br><em> </em>Brainstorming:<em> Before writing, have students brainstorm words, phrases, and images related to their target. Encourage them to think about the people, places, and actions involved.<br></em> <em>Sensory details:</em> Remind students to use sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to bring their haiku to life. For example, instead of saying \"factory,\" they could say \"clanging metal\" or \"spinning wheels.\"<br><em> </em>Figurative Language:<em> Encourage the use of metaphors, similies, and personification to create vivid imagery.<br></em> <em>Show, don't tell:</em> Guide students to \"show\" the essence of their target through concrete images rather than simply stating facts.<br><em> </em>Structure and Syllables:<em> Reiterate the 5-7-5 syllable structure and provide tools (like online syllable counters) if needed.<br></em> <em>Revision and refinement:</em> Encourage students to revise their haiku, focusing on word choice, imagery, and the overall impact of their poem.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

Emphasize that it's an opportunity to appreciate each other's work, share positive feedback, and gain different perspectives on Global Goal 8\\.<br>Begin the gallery walk with a few minutes of silent observation. This allows students to independently read and reflect on the haiku without distraction.<br>Allow students to give thoughtful feedback, either verbally in the moment or by providing them with small slips of paper to write comments on. Encourage students to give specific and constructive feedback, focusing on imagery and language, connection to the target, and emotional impact.<br>Remind students to be respectful of each other's work and to offer feedback in a positive and encouraging manner.<br>To facilitate the experience:<br><em> </em>Circulate and observe:<em> Walk around the classroom during the gallery walk, observing the student interactions and offering support as needed.<br></em> <em>Time management:</em> Provide a clear timeframe for the gallery walk to ensure that students have enough time to ready and respond to a number of the poems.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

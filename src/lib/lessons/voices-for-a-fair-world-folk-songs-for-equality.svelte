	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use their voices and the power of songs to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. You explain that it’s baout making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.<br>Explain that music has always been a powerful tool for this message. Introduce the characteristics of Folk Music. Clarify that folk music is often simple, and it’s music from the people. Explain that it’s often passed down from person to person and tells stories about everyday life, struggles, and the hope for a better, fairer world. Explain that folk music has been used throughout history as a way for people to have a voice and to come together to work for change.<br>Show images or video clips of folk singers or people singing together, or play a few simple folk song examples.<br>Examples:<br>Video<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaI5IRuS2aE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“This Land is Your Land”</a></em>,<em> Woody Guthrie<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVyVqnlFTdA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“If I Had a Hammer”</a>, Pete Seeger<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7akuOFp-ET8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“We Shall Overcome”</a>, Joan Baez<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b3RqnzgH1E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“The Times They Are A-Changin’”</a>, Bob Dylan<br>Audio<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAI6wjXEV6g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“I’ve Been Working on the Railroad”</a>, John Denver<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMFj8uDubsE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Blowin in the Wind”</a>, Bob Dylan<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eZ_M3EJG48\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“This Little Light of Mine”</a>, Etta James<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w67-hlaUSIs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Gracias a la Vida” Victoria Parra</a>, Chilean folk song celebrating life and resilience<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPQw79mvfeM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“In The Pines”</a>, Loretta Lynn<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tfPHBRIS14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Where Did You Sleep Last Night (In The Pines)”,</a> Nirvana, a haunting American folk song with mysterious origins and lyrics that vary widely from version to version (and has been performed by many artists), often featuring themes of loss, hardship, and death.<br><em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTLrFjYt8tA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“El Pueblo Unido Jamás Será Vencido (The People United Will Never Be Defeated)” Chilean folk</a>, A powerful anthem of resistance and unity against oppression.<br></em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyh_OVeQZH0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Bella Ciao” Italian Partisan Song</a>, A song of resistance and defiance associated with anti-fascist movements in Italy and beyond.<br>Facilitate a discussion about the characteristics of folk music with guiding questions like:<br><em> What do you notice about the music? Does it sound simple? Does it sound like you could sing it too?<br></em> How do the lyrics of these songs connect to the ideas of fairness and equality?<br><em> How does hearing people sing together make you feel about big ideas like justice and hope?<br></em> Can you think of any examples of folk music that you have heard in your own life?</p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Echoes of History"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will warm up their voices and start connecting to the tradition of music being passed down through echoing melodies.<br><em>Echo the Melody</em><br><em> Play or sing a simple melody. Instruct students to listen carefully and then echo the melody back to you with their voices, as if they are passing a song down to someone else.<br></em>Echo with Rhythm<em><br></em> Play or sing the melody again, but this time, add a simple rhythmic clap/tap/stomp/snap/etc. to it. Instruct students to echo both the melody and the rhythm back.<br><em>Echo with Emotion</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Play or sing the melody one more time, but with a specific emotional tone (e.g., determined, hopeful, joyful). Instruct students to echo the melody with their voices and add a facial expression that matches and conveys the emotion.</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude warm up by affirming the listening and vocal skills, explaining that they will use these to sing a folk song about Global Goal 10\\.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<ReflectionQuestions questions={["How did exploring the characteristics of folk music \\- its simplicity, storytelling, and focus on everyday life \\- help you connect with the complexities of reducing inequalities?","What did you learn about the power of music to amplify voices and unite people, especially in the context of fighting social injustices?","Did singing a song about fairness and equality together as a class create a sense of community or shared purpose? How did that feel?","What do these activities tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 10?","What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to promote fairness and equality, perhaps inspired by the music we made?"]} {sdgColor} />

	<AssessmentCriteria criteria={["Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, folk song exploration, collaborative singing, and discussions.","Understanding of the core concepts of reduced inequalities (fairness, equal opportunity, inclusion, respect for all), as demonstrated through the analysis of folk song messages and the contributions to the singing activities.","Originality and effectiveness in applying simple musical elements (e.g., rhythm, dynamics, simple harmonies, call and response) to convey the message about inequality and social justice.","Ability to work effectively with peers, listen to others’ musical contributions, and collaborate constructively during group activities and whole-class singing.","Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion."]} {sdgColor} />

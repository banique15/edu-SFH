	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an exciting art class. Explain that they will use their imaginations and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to build cities and towns that are great places to live, for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities are are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Inclusive:</em> Welcoming and fair for all people.</li>\n<li><em>Safe:</em> Places where everyone feels secure.</li>\n<li><em>Resilient:</em> Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.</li>\n<li><em>Sustainable:</em> Good for the planet and for people for a long time.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Begin by showing images of iconic Cubist paintings.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_%28L%C3%A9ger%29#/media/File:Fernand_L%C3%A9ger,_1919,_The_City_\\(La_Ville\\\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The City</em></a>,_oil_on_canvas,_231.1_x_298.4_cm,_Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art.jpg)<em>,</em> Fernand Léger</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/fernand-leger/men-in-the-city-1919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Men in the City</em></a><em>,</em> Fernand Léger</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/lyubov-popova/cubist-landscape-city-1914\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Cubist Landscape City</em></a><em>,</em> Lyubov Popova</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/juan-gris/still-life-with-checked-tablecloth-1915\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Still Life with Checked Tablecloth</em></a><em>,</em> Juan Gris</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-braque/houses-at-estaque-1908\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Houses at Estaque</em></a><em>,</em> Georges Braque</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111060/daniel-henry-kahnweiler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler</em></a><em>,</em> Pablo Picasso</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/still-life-with-the-caned-chair-1912\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Still Life with Caned Chair</em></a><em>,</em> Pablo Picasso</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/maria-blanchard/still-life-with-green-lamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Still Life with Green Lamp, María Blanchard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.arthistoryproject.com/artists/maria-blanchard/woman-seated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Woman Seated, María Blanchard</a></li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Explain that this is an art style called Cubism. Clarify that Cubist artists painted things in a very special way; instead of drawing something from just one point of view, they broke things apart into geometric shapes and showed them from many different viewpoints at the same time. Emphasize that this makes the art feel active and full of different perspectives.<br>`\t`Open a discussion about the artwork, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What do you notice about these paintings? Are the shapes round or pointy? Are the colors bright or dark?</li>\n<li>How are these paintings different from a “normal” photograph or painting/drawing? Why do you think the artists chose to paint things from all different sides at once?</li>\n<li>How do you think Cubist art, with its broken-apart shapes and many viewpoints, could help us think about a city? (e.g., a city has many different sides and different people, all at once).</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Fragmented Sketch Challenge"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the class will practice a key Cubist idea called fragmentation - or “breaking things apart.” Ensure all students have a piece of scrap paper and a writing utensil.<br>`\t`<em>Three Views</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students choose a simple object they can clearly see around the room, like a pencil or a water bottle. On their paper, have students quickly draw that object from three different viewpoints: the top, the side, and the bottom. Make sure students know it’s not about perfection.</li>\n<li>Give students a minute or two to quickly sketch.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>All Together Now</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, without erasing, have students draw all three of these viewpoints into a single, small sketch. They’ll have a funny, jumbled-up drawing that shows the object from all sides at once. This is fragmentation.</li>\n<li>Give students a few minutes to combine their viewpoints into one drawing.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Have a few students quickly share their fragmented sketches and explain what parts are from which viewpoint.<br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming students’ ability to think about objects from many different perspectives, a key skill for Cubism.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Exploring Cubist Techniques"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the class will explore the three main techniques of Cubism that will help to build their cities. Ensure all students have a piece of scrap paper and writing utensil.<br>`\t`<em>Fragmentation (Breaking Things Apart):</em> Explain that fragmentation means to break up objects into geometric shapes (what the class just did in the warm up activity).\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to quickly practice drawing a simple building and then breaking it into lots of different squares, triangles, and rectangles.</li>\n<li>Ask: How does this make the building look more interesting and active?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Geometric Forms:</em> Explain that Cubists used geometric shapes.\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to practice drawing and arranging simple geometric shapes (e.g., cubes, cones, cylinders) to make an abstract picture.</li>\n<li>Ask: How do these shapes remind you of buildings or objects you see every day?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Multiple Viewpoints:</em> Explain that showing an object from different views at the same time is a key Cubist idea.\n<ul>\n<li>Ask students to imagine a car. Have them draw the front of the car, and then right next to it (perhaps even touching), the side of the car. It will show two different views at once.</li>\n<li>Ask: How can showing many different views of a city or town help us understand how busy and complicated they are?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Conclude by affirming that the class will use all three of these ideas in the final artwork.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Community Block Blueprint"} content={"<p>`\t`Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a large piece of paper and markers.<br>`\t`<em>Draw the Block:</em> Instruct groups to draw a large square on their paper, representing a city block. Inside the square, they should draw a few simple buildings or houses, a road, a park, and maybe a school. Emphasize keeping it simple and using basic shapes.<br>`\t`<em>Add the “Good Stuff”:</em> Ask students to brainstorm all the things that make a city or town inclusive, safe, and sustainable (from Global Goal 11). Have them draw these ideas into their community block, using words or simple symbols.\n<ul>\n<li>Examples of “Good Stuff” to add: A happy family’s house (inclusive/safe), a recycling bin next to a factory (sustainable), a fast bus on the road (sustainble transportation), a park with lots of trees (green space), a new bike lane, solar panels on a roof, a lightbulb over a school to show learning, a person helping someone with a heavy bag, etc.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Cubist Sketching:</em> Ask groups to look at their completed Community Block Blueprint. Practicing the Cubist ideas they just learned, they will quickly sketch a building from their blueprint (can sketch as a group on the same page, same side or flip to the back side), but this time break it into geometric shapes and show it from two different viewpoints at once (e.g., the front and the side).<br>`\t`Conclude by explaining their final art will be a Cubist City that uses all these ideas to show a safe and sustainable community.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"My Sustainable City"} content={"<p>`\t`Give each student a large sheet of drawing paper and access to drawing/painting materials. Explain that they will now create their own Cubist-inspired artwork of a sustainable city or community, using the ideas they brainstormed, remembering to use the Cubist techniques they have learned: geometric shapes, fragmentation, and multiple viewpoints.<br>`\t`Encourage students to:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Break It Up:</em> Break up buildings, roads, or people into geometric shapes.</li>\n<li><em>Show From All Sides:</em> Show a building with its front sides, and roof all in the same picture.</li>\n<li><em>Use Symbolic Shapes:</em> Use a lightbulb shape for innovation, or a circle of people for community, etc.</li>\n<li><em>Use Bold Colors:</em> Use bright, contrasting colors to make the city feel alive and full of energy.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Circulate, offering encouragement and guidance with guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How are you using fragmentation to represent this idea?</li>\n<li>What message are you trying to convey with your use of geometric forms?</li>\n<li>How can you make a car look like it’s from the front and the side at the same time?</li>\n<li>What bright colors can you use to show a happy, safe city?</li>\n<li>Are you thinking about how the different parts of your city are all connected?</li>\n<li>What details show that your city is safe or sustainable?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Cubist Conversation Circle"} content={"<p>`\t`Have students find a comfortable spot to sit in a large circle, with their finished artwork with them. Explain that each student will get the chance to share their artwork and creative choices, and talk about the ideas in their piece.<br>`\t`Guide the conversation, ensuring each student has an opportunity to speak<br>`\t`<em>Presenting Your Piece:</em> Ask for a volunteer or choose a student to start, holding up their artwork for the class to see. Instruct them to briefly explain what they created, focusing on what they wanted to show about a safe and sustainable city. Prompt them to talk about the choices they made, with guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us about your artwork. What part of a city or town did you create?</li>\n<li>What Cubist techniques did you use (e.g., fragmented shapes, multiple views) to show your idea?</li>\n<li>What colors did you choose, and what do those colors make you feel?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Asking and Answering:</em> After the student presents their piece, invite the rest of the class to ask one or two simple questions about the artwork. Emphasize that questions should be respectful and aimed at understanding the artist’s choices, not criticizing the art. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>I see you used a lot of triangles in that part. Why did you choose that shape?</li>\n<li>You used a bright color here. What idea does that color represent in your city?</li>\n<li>You showed the road from the side and the top at the same time. What made you think to do that?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Continue this process around the circle until every student has had a chance to present their artwork and answer a few questions, or as time allows.<br>`\t`Facilitate a class discussion after the presentations, focusing on the connection between the artworks and Global Goal 11. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What are some of the common themes or messages you noticed across all the artworks?</li>\n<li>Did seeing a Cubist version of a city from a classmate’s artwork give you a new idea or perspective about what makes a good city?</li>\n<li>How did the different artworks, all using Cubist techniques, help us see the many different sides and ideas that make up a successful community?</li>\n<li>What was a creative way a classmate used fragmentation or geometric shapes to show a big idea about a city?</li>\n<li>How did the artworks show the importance of both people and buildings being part of a safe and sustainable community?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection and Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did exploring Cubism, with its focus on fragmentation and multiple perspectives, help you create your artwork about sustainable cities?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the importance of building cities and town that are inclusive, safe, and sustainable for everyone?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of abstract art to communicate comple social and environmental issues?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 11 and the importance of sustainable cities and communities through this artistic expression?</li>\n<li>What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to make your own community or city a better place?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, technique explorations, brainstorm, individual art creation, and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of sustainable cities (inclusive, safe, resilient), as demonstrated through the symbolism and intention within the artwork and verbal explanations during sharing and discussion.</li>\n<li>Originality and effort in creating the Cubist artwork. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 11 (does the artwork clearly represent ideas related to a safe, sustainable, or inclusive city from the brainstorm?), and use of Cubist elements (are there attempts to use geometric shapes, fragmentation, or multiple viewpoints to convey the message?).</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

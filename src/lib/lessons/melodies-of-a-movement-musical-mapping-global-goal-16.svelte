Emphasize the importance of these principles for a thriving global community.<br>Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing violence and promoting safety.</li>\n<li>Ending abuse and exploitation.</li>\n<li>Combating corruption and organized crime.</li>\n<li>Building effective and inclusive institutions.</li>\n<li>Promoting participation and access to information.</li>\n</ul><br>Connect musical mapping and Global Goal 16 by engaging the class in a discussion. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can we use musical elements to represent abstract ideas like peace or injustice? For example, what kind of tempo might represent urgency for change? What dynamics might symbolize the strength of institutions? What kind of instruments could represent different voices in a community?</li>\n</ul><br>Start with a story related to Global Goal 16 and collectively create a musical map that captures its essence.</p>"} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Begin by introducing UN Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships; the idea that for us to solve big problems like hunger or climate change, we can’t do it alone. We need to work together as a team, as a community, and as a world.<br>`\t`You can break down the goal into a few simple ideas:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Teamwork:</em> The goal recognizes that everyone, from world leaders to students in a classroom, has a role to play.</li>\n<li><em>Sharing:</em> It’s about sharing ideas, knowledge, and resources so that every country has what it needs to succeed.</li>\n<li><em>Working Together:</em> It’s about making sure that all our efforts are connected, so that we can create a stronger, better future for everyone.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Open a short class discussion to get students thinking about what good partnerships look like, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What does a good partnership look like?</li>\n<li>What makes a team successful?</li>\n<li>Can a partnership still be strong even if the people in it are different? Why or why not?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Next, introduce the main ideas of jazz music. Explain that jazz is a type of music that is all about working together.\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Team:</em> In a jazz band, you have a rhythm section (like the drums and bass) that keep a steady beat. This is like the foundation of a house.</li>\n<li><em>The Voice:</em> Then, you have a melody (the main tune) that is played by a saxophone, trumpet, etc. This is like the unique voice of a person or country.</li>\n<li><em>The Conversation:</em> The coolest part of jazz is called improvisation. This is when a musician makes up their own melody on the spot, but they are still listening and playing with the rest of the band. It’s like a conversation where everyone gets to say something different, but it all makes sense together.</li>\n<li><em>The Call and Answer:</em> Another important part of jazz is call and response. This is when one musician plays a short musical idea, and another musician “answers” it. This is a lot like a conversation in real life.</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Our Jazz Story"} content={"<p>`\t`Now, the class will connect the jazz rhythms to the ideas of Global Goal 17.

This new rhythm can represent a new idea or a solution.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>A Collective Solution (Harmony):</em>\n<ul>\n<li>As this new, hopeful rhythm is passed around the room, ask the rest of the class to join in, creating a collective, unified sound. This shows how a good idea can spread and how everyone’s voice can be a part of the solution.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Repeat this as many times as you’d like, pointing out different rhythms and feelings about the rhythms throughout.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

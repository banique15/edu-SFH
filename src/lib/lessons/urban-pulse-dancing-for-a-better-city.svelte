	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting dance and movement class. Explain that they will use the energy and creativity of dance to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.<br>Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to build cities and towns that are great places to live for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities that are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Inclusive:</em> Welcoming and fair for all people.</li>\n<li><em>Safe:</em> Places where everyone feels secure.</li>\n<li><em>Resilient:</em> Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.</li>\n<li><em>Sustainable:</em> Good for the planet and for people for a long time.</li>\n</ul><br>Introduce the concept of a Flash Mob. Explain that a flash mob is a group of people who suddenly gather in a public place to perform a fun, coordinated dance, then disperse just as quickly. Clarify that flash mobs are a creative way to surprise and delight people, and to share an important message without needing many words.<br>Show a short, compelling flash mob video that showcases a positive message or community engagement.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhcNLsSGApI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flash Mob Project: A Message of Peace</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37rVT_UCUpA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Universal Children’s Day Flash Mob Dance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1JKrFNdGFs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alex’s Lemonade Flash Mob</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bobsdanceshop/video/7456543255048752430\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bob’s Dance Shop Flash Mob</a></li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a discussion about the video, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What do you notice about the flash mob? Did the dancers all do the same thing? How did that feel to watch?</li>\n<li>What do you think the purpose of this flash mob was? Was it just for fun, or do you think they were trying to send a message?</li>\n<li>What kind of surprise or joy do you think a flash mob can create in a community?</li>\n<li>What about a flash mob makes it a great way to talk about building a strong community?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: The Urban Pulse"} content={"<p>Instruct students to find their own space with enough room to move around, closing their eyes gently if comfortable.<br><em>Individual Pulse</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students imagine their own inner pulse or beat, and start a quiet, simple rhythm with their body (e.g., a hand tap on their leg, a finger snap).</li>\n<li>This is their personal urban pulse.</li>\n<li>Guide students to find and maintain a personal rhythm.</li>\n</ul><br><em>Connecting the Pulse</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to open their eyes and walk slowly around the room, keeping their individual pulse going.</li>\n<li>When passing a classmate, encourage them to listen to the pulse and subtly match their rhythm. Clarify that their personal pulse shouldn’t stop, but that their rhythms should blend together as they pass each other.</li>\n<li>Guide students to walk and listen/connect.</li>\n</ul><br><em>The Collective Beat</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to find a person spot to stand, as the class will create on big, unified urban pulse together.</li>\n<li>Have students start with their simple, personal pulse, being aware and connecting with their classmates and their personal pulses.</li>\n<li>Have students listen to everyone’s beat and try to synchorize with their neighbors, becoming one big, strong, pulsing city.</li>\n<li>Guide the class to collectively amplify their rhythm, guiding them into a synchronized beat.</li>\n</ul><br><em>Freeze and Disperse</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have the class hold the collective pulse for a few seconds, then on your signal, have them freeze in a pose.</li>\n<li>On another signal, they disperse and go back to their individual pulse.</li>\n<li>Repeat this a few times.</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude warm up by affirming the responsiveness and shared energy, explaining that these skills are vital for a successful flash mob.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"City Challenge and Solution"} content={"<p>Explain to the class that they will brainstorm ideas for the upcoming flash mob’s choreography, which will tell a story about a problem and solution connected to Global Goal 11 in a fun, surprising way.<br>Choose a song that will resonate with the students and with the themes of sustainable cities and communities (even if loose). It should be upbeat, uplifting, and have a strong, clear beat that is easy to dance to. Use this same song for this activity and the entire flash mob.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYZ6gXWZfZM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Let’s Go</em></a><em>,</em> Calvin Harris ft.

Provide each group with one City Challenge Card and one City Solution Card.<br><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1brE9uHDnjwckWsD9thivvDoD7nRZshLzSKNJ2S9vxt0/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Example City Challenge Cards</a><br><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BSG3MEX3VQyLv-MyDX-eiUP458AbnATwXxoDBrAcgTs/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Example City Solution Cards</a><br>Instruct groups to read their two cards. Explain that groups will:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Brainstorm a Movement for the Challenge.</em></li>\n</ul><br><em>Ask:</em>\n<ul>\n<li>How can you use your bodies and gestures to show the problem on your Challenge Card? (e.g., slow, bumping movements for a traffic jam; messy, crumpled shapes for trash on the streets).</li>\n<li><em>Brainstorm a Movement for the Solution.</em></li>\n</ul><br><em>Ask:</em>\n<ul>\n<li>How can you use your bodies and gestures to show the solution on your Solutions Card? (e.g., smooth, pedaling motions for a new bike lane; active, scooping movements for a clean-up).</li>\n<li><em>Combine them into a Short Sequence.</em></li>\n<li>Have groups combine their challenge movement and their solution movement into a very short dance sequence (30 seconds or less) that tells a story connected to Global Goal 11. (e.g. a slow stuck movement representing the traffic jam, followed by a transition into a smooth, joyful pedaling movement for the new bike lane).</li>\n</ul><br>Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How can you show that lonely feeling with you body?</li>\n<li>How can the community clean-up movement look like everyone is working together?</li>\n</ul><br>Remind students to keep their movements simple and clear so everyone can learn them.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Flash Mob Rehearsal and Refinement"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will now learn everyone’s short dance sequence and combine them into one big, class flash mob.<br><em>Share the Moves</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have each group take a few minutes to clearly demonstrate their short movement sequence to the rest of the class. They should perform it slowly so everyone can see the movements and timing, as well as explaining the story behind their movements.</li>\n</ul><br><em>Assemble the Mob</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide the order of each group’s sequence to create a cohesive flow for the full flash mob.</li>\n<li>Create a teach simple transitions from one group’s sequence to the next, helping the class practice the full dance from beginning to end, focusing on the timing.</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Final Performance"} content={"<p>Conduct multiple full run-throughs of the flash mob, both without music and with the chosen song. Encourage students to perform with energy and enthusiasm.<br>Give positive feedback after each run-through.<br>[Optional] If appropriate, allowable, and students are comfortable, take the class to a more “public” part of the school to perform their flash mob dance.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did dancing, through our flash mob, help us think about what a sustainable city means?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of collective action and teamwork when we all worked together to create and perform our flash mob?</li>\n<li>What was the most challenging part of translating a big idea (like a sustainable city) into a small dance move? What was the most fun part?</li>\n<li>What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 11 and the importance of making cities inclusive, safe, and resilient through this activity?</li>\n<li>What is one key takeaway about sustainable cities and the role of dance and movement that you will remember from this lesson?</li>\n<li>What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to help build a better, more sustainable community?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Assessment"} content={"<ul>\n<li>Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, movement design, group rehearsals, and class discussions.</li>\n<li>Understanding of the core concept of sustainable cities (inclusive, safe, resilient), as demonstrated through the symbolism and intention within the movement sequences and verbal explanations.</li>\n<li>Originality and effectiveness in designing movements that visually and symbolically represent aspects of sustainable cities. Look for innovative and clear communication through physical expression.</li>\n<li>Ability to work effectively within the groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively during choreography and rehearsal. This also includes the dedication to practicing and refining the class-wide flash mob sequence, demonstrating an understanding of timing and synchronization.</li>\n<li>Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.</li>\n</ul>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>Welcome students to an exciting drama class. Explain that they will be using their acting skills and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 5, Gender Equality, which aims to make sure everyone (boys, girls, men and women) has fair and equal chances in life. Emphasize that this means everyone gets to be treated with respect, has the same opportunities to learn and grow, and can feel strong and proud of who they are, no matter their gender. Explain that it’s about being fair to all!<br>Explain to students that sometimes, the best way to understand big ideas, like making sure everyone is treated equally regardless of their gender, is to show them. Clarify that drama is a powerful way to show feelings, problems, and amazing solutions. Explain that actors use their voices, bodies, and imaginations to bring conversations to life, showing what characters are thinking and feeling.<br>Tell students that today, they will all become actors, performing their own short scenes where characters talk about fairness and equality, showing how acting can spark change.<br>[Optional] Show video clips from tv shows or movies that demonstrate characters speaking up for fairness, challenging stereotypes, or supporting each other.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieNyOBkF2tM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zootopia: Judy’s Speech</a> (focus on personal accountability and the importance of seeing people for who they are - not stereotypes).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDoP4ILwjg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Akeelah and the Bee: Winning Words</a> (focus on humility, collaboration, and standing up for what is right).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTg9Tfs6QQ&amp;t=23s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Next Karate Kid: Miyagi &amp; Julie</a> (focus on mentorship, standing up to injustice and challenging gender norms. Point out that physical violence is not how we solve problems in the real world).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT6FdhKriB8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inside Out: Sadness comforts Bing Bong</a> (focus on empathy and the importance of validating others’ feelings, especially when someone is struggling).</li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a brief discussion about the clips or the power of dialogue in general. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did the characters in these clips use their words and actions to show what they were feeling?</li>\n<li>Did any character speak up for themselves or someone else? How did that feel to watch?</li>\n<li>How did the characters’ words and movements help solve a problem or show fairness?</li>\n<li>What kind of power do words and acting have when people use them to talk about what’s fair or unfair?</li>\n<li>Can acting out a conversation make someone feel strong or supported? Why?</li>\n<li>What do characters say and do when they are challenging an unfair idea?</li>\n<li>How do characters show they are listening to each other in these conversations, even without speaking?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Opposite Actions/Words"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will warm up their minds and bodies for showing differen viewpoints in drama. Tell students that one person will do an action or say a word, and your partner will immediately do the opposite action or say an opposite word.<br><em>Opposite Actions</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Have students pair up (pick a partner or assign).</li>\n<li>Say: You will do a simple action, and your partner will immediately do the exact opposite! If you point up, your partner will point down. If you make a loud clap, your parter will make the tiniest whisper clap with two fingers.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate examples for the class if needed:</li>\n<li><em>Partner 1:</em> Make a big, slow step forward. <em>Partner 2:</em> Make a small, quick step backward.</li>\n<li><em>Partner 1:</em> Make a tight, closed fist. <em>Partner 2:</em> Make an open, relaxed hand.</li>\n<li><em>Partner 1:</em> Make a fast, wiggly dance. <em>Partner 2:</em> Make a slow, stiff dance.</li>\n<li><em>Partner 1:</em> Make a big, happy smile. <em>Partner 2:</em> Make a small, sad frown.</li>\n<li>Give students a few minutes to try this with their partners, circulating and giving encouragement. Have students switch who is “starting” the actions so each students gets a turn to try each.</li>\n</ul><br><em>Opposite Words</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Say: Let’s try with words! You will say a word, and your partner will say the opposite as quickly as possible. Then you will bounce those two words back and forth together as fast as you can until I say “Stop!” This will warm up your quick thinking, quick responsiveness, and physical/vocal flexibility.<em></li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li></em>Partner 1:<em> Up! </em>Partner 2:<em> Down! </em>Then, back and forth P1:<em> Up! </em>P2:<em> Down! </em>P1:<em> Up! </em>P2:<em> Down! etc.</li>\n<li></em>Partner 1:<em> Loud! </em>Partner 2:<em> Quiet! </em>Then, back and forth P1:<em> Loud! </em>P2:<em> Quiet! </em>P1:<em> Loud! </em>P2:<em> Quiet! etc.</li>\n<li></em>Partner 1:<em> Happy! </em>Partner 2:<em> Sad! </em>Then, back and forth P1:<em> Happy! </em>P2:<em> Sad! </em>P1:<em> Happy! </em>P2:<em> Sad! etc.</li>\n<li></em>Partner 1:<em> Easy! </em>Partner 2:<em> Hard! </em>Then, back and forth P1:<em> Easy! </em>P2:<em> Hard! </em>P1:<em> Easy! </em>P2:<em> Hard! etc.</li>\n<li></em>Partner 1:<em> Fair! </em>Partner 2:<em> Unfair! </em>Then, back and forth P1:<em> Fair! </em>P2:<em> Unfair! </em>P1:<em> Fair! </em>P2:* Unfair! Etc.</li>\n<li>For each word pair, let the students “ping pong” the words back and forth for 10-20 seconds each, for a total of about 3 minutes, giving both students in the pair a chance to be “Partner 1”.</li>\n</ul><br>Conclude by affirming the students’ quick thinking and flexibility, explaining that just like opposites can help us understand things better, acting out different viewpoints can help us understand fairness better.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Fairness Crossroads Brainstorm"} content={"<p>Explain that the students will create fairness crossroads brainstorms to help them prepare for their scenes. They will think about a moment where characters face a choice about gender equity, and what words and actions they might use on different paths.<br>Have each student take a piece of paper. Instruct them to draw a simple “crossroads” or “fork in the road” on the paper.\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Situation (Start of the Road):</em> Instruct students to draw a simple picture or write 2-3 words at the beginning of their road that shows a situation where fairness when it comes to gender is important.</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Two kids want the same ball.</li>\n<li>Someone says “girls can’t build”.</li>\n<li>A friend is chosen last for a team.</li>\n<li>Chores need to be done at home.</li>\n<li>A new student joins the class.</li>\n<li>Someone has a different idea.</li>\n<li>A comment about someone’s clothes being “for boys” or “for girls”.</li>\n<li>Someone feeling left out because of a stereotype.</li>\n<li><em>The Unfair Path (One Direction):</em> Instruct students to draw or write a few words down one path they choose. Ask: What words or actions would characters say or do if they chose an unfair path in this situation? What would happen if they didn’t share, or said something unfair, or acted in way that left someone out?</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Saying “The ball is mine because I’m a boy!”</li>\n<li>Saying “You can’t play.”</li>\n<li>Making fun of someone.</li>\n<li>Ignoring ideas.</li>\n<li>Saying “That’s a boy/girl thing.”</li>\n<li>Complaining about chores.</li>\n<li>Making someone feel left out.</li>\n<li>Someone turning their back on another person.</li>\n<li><em>The Fair Path (Other Direction):</em> Instruct students to draw or write a few words down the other path. Ask: What words or actions would characters say or do if they chose a fair and equal path? How would they solve the problem with kindness or respect, or show that everyone has a chance?</li>\n</ul><br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Saying “Let’s Share!”</li>\n<li>Taking turns.</li>\n<li>Inviting everyone.</li>\n<li>Saying “It’s okay to cry.”</li>\n<li>Saying “Everyone is good at something.”</li>\n<li>Working together.</li>\n<li>Saying “That’s a great idea!”</li>\n<li>Giving compliments.</li>\n<li>Offering a helping hand.</li>\n<li>Someone smiling and including others.</li>\n<li>Using a kind and steady voice.</li>\n</ul><br>Circulate, offering support and asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What big feeling is happening on your “unfair” path?</li>\n<li>What words and actions show that?</li>\n<li>What kind of dialogue and movement shows the characters trying to make things fair on the other path?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Character Clash: Everyday Fairness"} content={"<p>Divide students into pairs (or groups of 3 if necessary) and have them choose, as a group, one idea from their brainstorm that they want to act out. (They will choose one situation, one unfair path, and one fair path that can work together in one scene.)<br>Instruct each pair or group to to quickly brainstorm characters for their scene. These characters should have different viewpoints or roles related to the fairness situation they chose.<br>Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Fair Play:</em> A friend who thinks a game is only for boys and another friend who wants everyone to play.</li>\n<li><em>Sharing Ideas:</em> A student with a really good idea, and another student who interrupts or tries to ignore them because of their gender.</li>\n<li><em>Feelings Matter:</em> A classmate who says “Boys don’t cry,” and another classmate who gently says “It’s okay to cry, feelings are for everyone.”</li>\n<li><em>Teamwork at Home:</em> A character who thinks only one gender should do chores, and another who suggests sharing all chores equally.</li>\n<li><em>Trying New Things:</em> A student who wants to try a new activity (like ballet or coding) but is told it’s not for them, and a supportive friend encourages them.</li>\n<li><em>Mediating a Problem (example for group of three):</em> Two friends are arguing over who can use a certain toy based on whether it is “boy” or “girl” toy. A third friend arrives and helps them understand toys are for anyone who wants to enjoy them.</li>\n<li><em>Welcoming Newcomers:</em> Two students who are already friends (and the same gender), and a new student who feels shy because they don’t know anyone; one of the original friends makes them feel welcome.</li>\n<li><em>Trying New Things:</em> A student who wants to try a new activity (like ballet or coding) but is told it’s not for them, and a supportive friend encourages them.</li>\n<li><em>Mediating a Problem (example for group of three):</em> Two friends are arguing over who can use a certain toy based on whether it is “boy” or “girl” toy.

	<CustomSection title={"Improvising Scenes: Speaking Up for Fairness"} content={"<p>Explain that the class will now use their chosen fairness crossroads situations and their brainstormed characters to act out a short scene. Their scene should last about 1-2 minutes.<br>Clarify that students will improvise the dialogue and actions based on the situation and characters they have created, focusing on:\n<ul>\n<li><em>The Challenge:</em> How the unfair situation or stereotype is revealed through what characters say and do.</li>\n<li><em>The Change/Solution:</em> How the characters talk about it, challenge the unfairness, or show support to make things more fair.</li>\n<li><em>Showing Feelings:</em> Use your voice (tone, loudness, speed) and body (posture, gestures, facial expressions) to show what your characters are feeling (e.g., frustration, sadness, bravery, happiness).</li>\n<li><em>Listening and Reacting:</em> Pay close attention to what your partner(s) say and do, and react realistically, just like in a real conversation.</li>\n</ul><br>Provide optional starting lines if needed or simple prompts for the scene. Examples:\n<ul>\n<li>Why do you always say that?</li>\n<li>But I think everyone should get a turn!</li>\n<li>That’s not fair because…</li>\n<li>What if we tried…</li>\n<li>I heard you say…and that didn’t feel fair.</li>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if you’re a boy or a girl, you can still…</li>\n<li>Your idea is great!</li>\n<li>Let’s make sure everyone is included.</li>\n</ul><br>Encourage students to use their voices effectively (loud, soft, fast, slow) and their bodies to show emotions and actions. Circulate the room, offering support and guidance as they improvise. Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How are your characters showing they are [feeling frustrated/brave/confused/joyful/etc.] with their body and voice?</li>\n<li>What physical action could your character do to show they are trying to [listen/help/challenge/etc.]?</li>\n<li>What words might your character say to make the other character(s) stop and think about fairness?</li>\n<li>How does your character react to what they other character(s) say? Show us with your face and body!</li>\n<li>Is your scene showing a clear change from the unfair path to the fair path you brainstormed?</li>\n<li>What kind of voice could your character use to sound firm but kind when speaking up?</li>\n<li>Could you use a simple prop to help tell your story? (if props are available)</li>\n<li>How do your characters’ actions show they are listening and thinking about what the other person is saying?</li>\n<li>How can you use pauses in the dialogue to make a moment more powerful?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Performance and Peer Feedback"} content={"<p>Have each pair/group perform their improvised scene for the class.<br>After each scene is performed, encourage peers to provide kind and helpful feedback, focusing on:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Clear Message:</em> Did the conversation and actions make it clear what the characters were struggling with regarding fairness, or what solutions they found? What was the main message about gender equality that came through?</li>\n<li><em>Character Portrayal:</em> Did the characters feel real? Did you believe what they were saying and how they were feeling based on their voices and actions?</li>\n<li><em>Impact:</em> How did this scene make you feel? Did it make you think differently about fairness or how you could speak up?</li>\n</ul><br>Facilitate a brief discussion, asking guided questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What common ideas about fairness or speaking up did you hear across different scenes today?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about how our words and actions can help make things fair for everyone?</li>\n<li>Did any specific line or action from a scene stand out to you as particularly powerful? Why?</li>\n<li>How did seeing these conversations acted out make the ideas about gender equality feel more real or important?</li>\n<li>What kind of spark did these scene create in your mind about how you can use your voice and actions to promote fairness?</li>\n<li>Did any scene remind you of something you’ve seen or heard in your own life related to fairness, and how might you respond differently now?</li>\n<li>What’s one new way you might try to use your words or actions to be fair or supportive after this lesson?</li>\n<li>How did the characters’ conversations and actions show the fairness crossroads you brainstormed earlier?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Reflection & Summary"} content={"<p>Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.<br>Ask guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>How did acting out conversations help you explore what fairness and equality mean for everyone?</li>\n<li>What did you learn about the power of using your voice and body to show feelings, solve problems, and help make things fair?</li>\n<li>Which scenes or ideas from your classmates made you think or feel the most about gender equality, and why?</li>\n<li>What does this activity tell us about how we can all work toward Global Goal 5: Gender Equality?</li>\n<li>What’s one small word or action you feel inspired to use this week to promote gender equality and respect in your school or home?</li>\n</ul></p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<Introduction content={"<p>`\t`Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use the power of song to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.<br>`\t`Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promised to build cities and towns that are great places to live for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities that are:\n<ul>\n<li><em>Inclusive:</em> Welcoming and fair for all people.</li>\n<li><em>Safe:</em> Places where everyone feels secure.</li>\n<li><em>Resilient:</em> Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.</li>\n<li><em>Sustainable:</em> Good for the planet and for people for a long time.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Begin with a brief introduction to the blues. Explain that the blues is a very special kind of music that started a long time ago in America. Clarify that the blues is all about telling a story with music, especially a story about a problem, and then finding a way to feel better, or find hope and strength, even when things are tough. Explain that the blues is a powerful way to express feelings and give a voice to people’s challenges.<br>`\t`Play examples of age-appropriate, classic blues or blues inspired songs, highlighting the emotional depth and storytelling aspect of the genre.<br>`\t`Examples:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4tL-zeVRbk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Everyday I Have the Blues”</a><em>,</em> B.B. King</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEsQikthT3Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Walking Blues”</a><em>,</em> Robert Johnson</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6hQ9HSKlIE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Give Me One Reason”</a><em>,</em> Tracy Chapman</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmpwvxW0gW0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Hound Dog”</a>,* Big Mama Thornton</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vchl9yUo3Fo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Mean Old Bedbug Blues”</a>, Bessie Smith</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Guide students to think abou the emotions and stories in the songs, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What emotions do you hear in these songs? Do you hear sadness, strength, or maybe a little bit of both?</li>\n<li>How does the music make you feel? Does it sound heavy or strong?</li>\n<li>What kind of story do you think the singer is telling?</li>\n</ul></p>"} />

	<CustomSection title={"Warm Up: Blues Feelings and Motions"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the Blues connects a feeling to a rhythm, and that in this warm up the class will listen to a basic blues progression and move in a way that expresses the feelings that naturally come from the song.<br>`\t`Play a simple, instrumental blues progression.<br>`\t`Example\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3AbKYn0gwY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12 Bar Blues Backing Track in A</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7b9qqcT4M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shuffle 12 Bar Blues in E</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnXVrMbnyLU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Classic 12 Bar Blues in C Major</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpTr1lfG0WY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bb - Medium Tempo 12 Bar Blues Backing Track</a></li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Listen to the Feeling</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to move their body in a way that expresses the feeling of the blues.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions while the movement is happening, like:</li>\n<li>The blues often starts with a feeling of sadness or frustration, what does that look like in your body?</li>\n<li>Do you move slowly?</li>\n<li>Is it a heavy feeling?</li>\n<li>Is it a tired feeling?</li>\n<li>Encourage students to move in a way that expresses this feeling, whether with a full body motion or a small finger tap.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Move to the Beat</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to let their body movements follow the beat and rhythm of the song. Explain that the rhythm of the blues is a repeating pattern that is often slow and steady.</li>\n<li>Encourage students to move in a way that follows this rhythm, allowing them to feel the emotions of the song.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`<em>Find the Hope</em>\n<ul>\n<li>Instruct students to shift their movements to a more hopeful and determined feeling.</li>\n<li>Ask guiding questions while the movement is happening, like:</li>\n<li>The blues is not just about sadness, it is also about hope and resilience. How does your body move when it feels hopeful?</li>\n<li>Is it a stronger movement?</li>\n<li>Is it a more open movement?</li>\n<li>Encourage students to move in a way that expresses this feeling, allowing them to feel the emotions of the song.</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Conclude warm up by affirming the connection students have made to the musical structure of the blues, and their ability to translate abstract feelings and emotions into concrete musical ideas, a foundational skill for writing and performing the blues.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

	<CustomSection title={"Blues and Global Goal 11"} content={"<p>`\t`Explain that the blues is a perfect medium for telling stories about cities and communities. Clarify that blues songs often use a simple structure to tell a story:\n<ul>\n<li>Line A (a problem)</li>\n<li>Line A (the same problem, maybe with a small change)</li>\n<li>Line B (a solution or a hope)</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Explain this AAB structure in a simple, relatable way. You can reference some of the original song examples from the beginning of the lesson, or give a simple, non-Global Goal 11 example if helpful:\n<ul>\n<li>My dog ran away and hid down the street <em>(A)</em></li>\n<li>My dog ran away he just wanted a treat <em>(A)</em></li>\n<li>I found him with a bone, my day’s now complete <em>(B)</em></li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Then connect this structure to Global Goal 11. Ask students to think about problems and hopes in their own cities and communities, asking guiding questions like:\n<ul>\n<li>What’s a problem you’ve seen in our city or community?</li>\n<li>What’s a hope or a solution for that problem?</li>\n</ul><br>`\t`Explain that they will use these ideas to write their own blues songs.</p>"} {sdgColor} />

**Introduction**

Introducing Dadaism

- Dada was an art movement that emerged during World War I as a reaction to what artists saw as the senselessness and absurdity of the war and the societal norms that led to it. It was anti-art, rejecting logic, reason, and traditional aesthetics.
- Key characteristics:
  - Randomness
  - Chance
  - Collage
  - Assemblage
  - Wordplay

Show examples of Dada artwork, emphasizing the diverse materials and the illogical combinations.

- [Merzbild 1A. The mental doctor](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kurt-schwitters-merzbild-1a-the-mental-doctor) by Kurt Schwitters Collage made from discarded materials, emphasizing the beauty in the everyday and the unexpected combinations.
- [Hannah Höch’s photomontages](https://www.moma.org/artists/2675-hannah-hoch). Layered images from magazines and newspapers, often with a satirical or social commentary.
- [Spirit of the Age: Mechanical Head](https://smarthistory.org/hausmann-head/) by Raoul Hausmann An assemblage of found objects attached to a wigmaker’s dummy head, questioning societal norms and the dehumanizing aspects of industialization.
- [Readymades](https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/dada/marcel-duchamp-and-the-readymade), including the famous [Fountain](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573) by Marcel Duchamps Everday objects presented as art, challenging the definition of art and the role of the artist’s hand. While not strictly collage, the concept of recontextualizing existing elements aligns with Dada’s spirit.

Briefly discuss the collaborative nature of some Dada activities and the idea of collective creation.

While Dada is often associated with individual rebellion and a rejection of established norms, it also had a strong undercurrent of collaboration and collective creation. This stemmed from several factors.

- *Shared Anarchy and Disillusionment:* Dada artists were united by their shared outrage at the war and the perceived failrues of bourgeois society. This common ground naturally led to artists working together, finding strength and validation in their collective dissent. Creating art together became a way to amplify their message and build a sense of community within their movement.
- *Rejection of the Individual Genius Myth:* Dada challenged the traditional Romantic idea of the solitary artistic genius. They often embraced chance, the readymade, and collaborative processes as a way to undermine the notion of individual artistic mastery and intention. By creating art collectively, they emphasized the role of the group and the unexpected outcomes that could arise from shared creation, rather than the singular vision of one artist.
- *Experimentation and Play:* Dada was fundamentally experimental and playful. Collaborative activities provided a fertile ground for exploring new ideas and techniques, without the constraints of individual ego or preconceived notions.
- *Building a Movement:* Collaboration was also a practical way for Dada artists to build and sustain their movement. By working together on exhibitions, publications, and performances, they created a stronger collective voice and gained more visibility. These collaborative efforts helped to solidify Dada as a significant force in the art world, even if its core tenet was anti-establishment.
- *Shared Authorship:* The traditional notion of a single author or artist was often dissolved in collaborative Dada projects. The final artwork became a product of the group’s interaction, with individual contributions merging into something new and often surprising.
- *Embracing the Unexpected:* Because Dada often incorporated chance and the input of multiple individuals, the outcomes of collective creation were frequently unpredictable. This embrace of the unexpected was a key element of the Dada aesthetic, reflecting their view of a chaotic and irrational world.
- *Breaking Down Boundaries:* Collaborative Dada activities blurred the lines between different art forms (poetry, visual art, performance) and also between artists themselves. This interdisciplinary and collaborative spirit was a way of challenging artistic conventions and exploring new possibilities for creative expression.
- *Social Interaction as Art:* For Dadaists, the act of creating together was often as important as the final product. The interactions, the disagreements, the unexpected connections that arose during collaborative sessions were all part of the artistic experience.

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Emphasize that it recognizes that achieving all the other Global Goals for Sustainable Development requires collaboration and cooperation across countries, sectors, and among individuals.

Briefly touch upon some key aspects of Global Goal 17: financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, trade, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Connect Dadaism and Global Goal 17

- At first glance, Dada’s chaos might seem unrelated to the serious work of global partnerships. However, think about how Dada artists challenged existing norms and created something new through collaboration and unexpected combinations.
- Today, we’ll explore collaborative Dada collage as a way to think about how diverse elements - different perspectives, resources, ideas - can be brought together, sometimes in surprising ways, to build the partnerships needed for a sustainable future.
- Just as Dada artists combined disparate materials to create new meanings, we’ll work together to create collaborative collages that might spark fresh perspectives on global cooperation and the unexpected power of diverse contributions.

**Collaborative Dada Collage: Partnerships for Progress**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).

Introduce the concept of Dada collage: creating artwork by adhering various materials (paper, text, found objects) to a surface in unexpected and often random arrangements.

Explain that the collaborative aspect will involve each group member contributing materials and participating in the arrangement of the shared collage.

Assign each group a specific aspect of Global Goal 17 to focus on for their collage (e.g., “financial resources,” “technology transfer,” “capacity building,” “trade,” “multi-stakeholder partnerships”). Alternatively, the entire class can focus on the overarching theme of “Partnerships for the Goals.”

Each group gathers their materials.

Students take turns adding elements to the shared surface, building upon what others have contributed.

Encourage spontaneity, intuitive placement, and unexpected junxtapositions.

Remind students to think about how their individual contributions and the overall arrangement might symbolicalluy relate to their assigned theme or Goal 17 in general.

- For example: Fragments of different maps could represent global collaboration, while contrasting textures could symbolize diverse resources coming together.

**Group Sharing and Interpretation**

Each group shares their collaborative Dada collage with the class.

Guide the sharing with questions like:

- What was your group’s assigned theme (if applicable)?
- Describe the different materials and elements you used in your collage.
- How did the collaborative process unfold? How did different members contribute?
- What unexpected combinations or juxtapositions emerged in your artwork?
- How might the different elements or the overall feeling of your Dada collage connect to the idea of “Partnerships for the Goals”?
- Can you identify any symbolic representations of different entities (countries, organizations, ideas) coming together in your artwork?
- How does the element of chance or the unexpected in Dada relate to the challenges and opportunities of global collaboration?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect ont heir learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the collaborative collage process, where different elements came together in unexpected ways, help you understand the dynamics of global partnerships?
- What did you learn about the power of juxtaposition and unexpected combinations in art to represent complex ideas about cooperation or diverse contributions?
- Did embracing the element of chance in our Dada collages open your mind to new ways of thinking about how solutions can emerge in global challenges?
- How did working together to create a single, shared artwork, even with disparate materials, reflect the idea of different nations or organizations pooling resources?
- What did you discover about your own creative responses when faced with materials and ideas contributed by others?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 17 and the importance of diverse and strong partnerships for sustainable development through this art activity?
- How did your group’s collage, or those created by other groups, highlight different facets or challenges related to Global Goal 17 (e.g., financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, multi-stakeholder collaboration)?
- Did the activity make you think differently about who needs to be involved in solving global problems and how their unique contributions can fit together?
- How can an artistic approach, even one rooted in “nonsense’ like Dada, help us to visualize and grasp the complexities of global partnerships?
- Did creating this collaborative collage spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with teamwork, compromise, or building something together?
- What emotions did you connect with during this art activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 17?
- What is one key takeaway about global partnerships and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- What is one specific action, big or small, that you feel inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to achieving Global Goal 17?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Dadaism, understanding techniques, collaborative art creation, group sharing, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., financial resources, technology transfer, multi-stakeholder partnerships) as demonstrated through the symbolism and intention within the collaborative collage and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying chosen Dada elements (e.g., collage, assemblage, unexpected juxtapositions, embracing chance) to convey the message about global partnerships.
- How clearly and powerfully the finished collaborative artwork communicates its intended message about Global Goal 17. Did the piece successfully provoke thought or emotion related to global cooperation and diverse contributions?
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing materials, respecting diverse artistic choices, building upon previous elements, and collaborating cohesively to create the shared piece.
- Ability to articulate contributions and the collective outcome, and to interpret and provide thoughtful feedback on other groups’ artwork, connecting it to Global Goal 17.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of collaborative art in addressing global challenges and the complexities of building effective partnerships.

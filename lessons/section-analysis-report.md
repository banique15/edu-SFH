## Patterns and Observations

### Standard Lesson Structure
Most lessons follow a consistent structure:
1. **Materials** (178 files)
2. **Introduction** (159 files)
3. Lesson-specific activity sections (unique to each lesson)
4. **Reflection and Summary** (164 files)
5. **Assessment** (163 files)

### Exploration Lessons Pattern
The `*-exploration.md` files follow a specific pattern:
- **Materials**
- **[Art Form] Examples** (Song Examples, Drama Examples, Art Examples)
- **Viewing** (for art exploration)
- **Discussion**
- **Personal Connection**
- **Closing Activity Options**

### Activity-Specific Sections
Many lessons include sections specific to their art form or activity:
- **Warm Up** variations (39 files)
- **Cool Down** variations (9 files)
- **Exploring [Technique]** sections
- **Creating [Artwork]** sections
- **Gallery Walk** variations
- **Sharing and Discussion** variations

### Naming Conventions
- Most shared sections use consistent naming
- Some variations exist (e.g., "Reflection and Summary" vs "Reflection & Summary")
- Unique sections often include colons for subsections (e.g., "Warm Up: [Activity Name]")

---

## Recommendations

1. **Standardization**: Consider standardizing section names where variations exist (e.g., "Reflection and Summary" vs "Reflection & Summary")

2. **Template Creation**: Create lesson templates based on the common structure:
   - Materials
   - Introduction
   - [Activity-specific sections]
   - Reflection and Summary
   - Assessment

3. **Exploration Lesson Template**: Create a specific template for exploration lessons with:
   - Materials
   - [Art Form] Examples
   - Viewing (for art)
   - Discussion
   - Personal Connection
   - Closing Activity Options

4. **Section Naming Guidelines**: Establish guidelines for naming unique sections to maintain consistency while allowing for creativity

---

## Methodology

This analysis was performed by:
1. Extracting all section headers (marked with `**Section Name**`) from all 179 lesson files
2. Counting occurrences of each unique section name
3. Categorizing sections as "shared" (appearing in 2+ files) or "unique" (appearing in 1 file)
4. Identifying patterns and naming conventions

---

## File Statistics

- **Total lesson files**: 179
- **Total section headers found**: 1,444+
- **Shared sections (2+ files)**: ~50-100 unique section names
- **Unique sections (1 file)**: ~1,300+ unique section names

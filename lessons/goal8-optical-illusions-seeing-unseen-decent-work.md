**Introduction and Inspiration**  
	Begin by engaging students in a discussion about their perceptions of work and economic growth. What images or ideas come to mind when they hear these terms?

* When you hear the word "work," what's the first thing that comes to mind?  
* What about "economic growth"? What does that look like to you?  
* Is all work the same? What makes some jobs "better" than others?  
* Can you think of any jobs that are invisible or undervalued?  
* Can economic growth happen without harming people or the planet? How?  
* Does everyone have the same opportunities for decent work? Why or why not?

Introduce the concept of "optical illusions" and how Op Art plays with our visual perceptions. Show examples of Op Art and discuss the techniques used to create these illusions.  
Op Art Examples

* Victor Vasarely, ["Vega-Nor"](https://www.wikiart.org/en/victor-vasarely/vega-nor-1969)  
* Bridget Riley, ["Movement in Squares"](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/movement-in-squares-bridget-riley/dwGpQ5o3Dc4FrQ)  
* Yaacov Agam, ["Double Metamorphosis II"](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/3746)  
* Marina Apollonio, ["Rilievo 703"](https://garadinervi-repertori.blog/post/762431808105332736/marina-apollonio-rilievo-703-aluminum-and?is_related_post=1)

	Techniques

* *Geometric Patterns:* Tessellations, repeating shapes, optical grids to create illusions of movement and vibration.  
* *Contrasting Colors:* High-contrast colors placed next to each other to create a sense of depth and movement.  
* *Lines and Shapes:* Curved lines, spirals, geometric shapes to create illusions of warping, bulging, or receding.  
* *Figure-Ground Reversal:* Playing with positive and negative space to creat ambiguous images that shift between foreground and background.  
* *Moiré Patterns:* Overlapping layers of lines or dots to create interference patterns and a sense of vibration.

**Connecting Op Art to Global Goal 8**  
	Guide students to explore how Op Art can be used to represent the complexities and sometimes "hidden" aspects of decent work and economic growth.  
	*Start with the "Why"*

* Why might Op Art be a good way to show things about decent work and economic growth that we don't always see?  
  * It reveals hidden layers, plays with perception, just like these issues and aspects we don't notice at first.

	*Unpack the "Complexities"*

* What are some things about work taht are complex or have hidden sides to them?  
  * Power dynamics, unseen labor, the impact on mental health, etc.  
* What about economic growth? Can it have downsides too?  
  * Inequality, environmental damage, unsustainable practices.

	*Link to Op Art's Strengths*

* How can Op Art techniques help us show these hidden sides or complexities?  
  * Illusions of depth, things appearing/disappearing, contrasting elements to show opposing forces.

	*Provide Concrete Examples*

* Imagine a pattern where the lines seem perfectly parallel, but as you look closer, they subtly diverge. What could that represent in terms of economic growth?  
  * Growing inequality even as the economy expands.  
* What if an image seems to have solid shapes, but they flicker and become unstable when you move? How might that connect to job security or labor rights?  
  * Precarious work, lack of protection.

	Discuss how Op Art can symbolize:

* **Target 8.1** *(Economic Growth):* Use expanding or converging lines to represent growth or decline, or create patterns that show the interconnectedness of economies.  
* **Target 8.2** *(Productivity):* Use overlapping shapes and contrasting colors to depict the integration of technology and human labor in increasing productivity.  
* **Target 8.3** *(Entrepreneurship):* Use vibrant colors and dynamic shapes to represent innovation, creativity, and the growth of small businesses.  
* **Target 8.4** *(Resource Efficiency):* Use a repeating pattern with subtle variations to represent the cyclical use of resources in a circular economy.  
* **Target 8.5** *(Decent Work):* Create illusions of balance and imbalance to represent equality or inequality in the workplace. Use contrasting colors to depict the gender/racial pay gap.  
* **Target 8.6** *(Youth Employment):* Use converging lines that lead to a central point, symbolizing the importance of education and training in guiding young people towards fulfilling careers.  
* **Target 8.7** *(Child Labor):* Use distorted figures or hidden images to represent the exploitation of children and the need to bring this issue to light.  
* **Target 8.8** *(Labor Rights):* Use strong lines and geometric patterns to symbolize the structures that protect workers' rights and create safe working environments.  
* **Target 8.9** *(Sustainable Tourism):* Use Op Art techniques to depict the beauty and diversity of cultural heritage and natural landscapes, highlighting the importance of preserving these assets for sustainable tourism.  
* **Target 8.10** *(Financial Inclusion):* Use a pattern that gradually becomes more complex and interconnected, representing the expansion of access to financial services for all.

**Op Art Creation**  
	Divide students into small groups or allow them to work individually.  
	Each group/student selects one target from Global Goal 8 (or can focus on the Goal holistically), and creates an Op Art piece that represents a specific aspect of that target/goal.  
	Encourage students to experiment with different Op Art techniques to convey their chosen message effectively.

* While students work, circulate to observe, offer encouragement, and answer questions. Prompt deeper thinking:  
  * I see you're using a lot of wavy lines. How does that connect to the target you chose?  
  * What's the hidden element in your design? How does it make the viewer look closer?  
  * Are the colors you've chosen symbolic of anything related to this issue?

**Pair and Explain**  
	Once the artwork is complete, have students pari up with someone (if targets were chosen instead of the broad goal, someone who chose a different target). This encourages cross-learning about various aspects of Goal 8\.  
	Provide prompts to guide their discussion together:

* Describe your artwork to your partner. What techniques did you use?  
* Explain which target you chose and how your artwork represents it? OR Explain how your artwork represents Global Goal 8?  
* What message do you hope to convey through your art?  
* What's one action someone could take to contribute to this target/goal?

	Active Listening: The listener should summarize what they heard and ask clarifying questions.

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* What were some of the most important lessons you learned from this project?  
* How did the different installations contribute to your understanding of Global Goal 8?  
* What are some of the biggest challenges and opportunities related to achieving decent work and economic growth?  
* What new information or insights did you gain about employment and economic growth through this project?  
* Did anything surprise you?  
* How did the process of creating a piece of Op Art deepen your understanding of your assigned target/goal?  
* How did you feel while working on this project? Were there any moments of frustration, excitement, or inspiration?  
* What emotions did the other works evoke in you?  
* How do you feel about the role of art in addressing global challenges like decent work and economic growth?  
* Did this project change your perspective on employment and economic development? If so, how?  
* What new ideas or possibilities did you discover for creating a more sustainable future?  
* How can you apply what you learned from this project to your own life and choices?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial discussion on work/economy, introduction to Op Art, brainstorming, individual/group art creation, and class discussions (including pair explanations).  
* Comprehension of Global Goal 8 and its targets and core concepts (e.g., fair wages, safe conditions, youth employment, sustainable growth). This will be evidenced through the symbolism and intention within the Op Art piece and the verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effectiveness in applying chosen Op Art elements (e.g., geometric patterns, contrasting colors, lines/shapes for illusion, figure-ground reversal) to represent the complexities and "hidden" aspects of decent work and economic growth.  
* How clearly and powerfully the finished Op Art piece communicates its intended message about Global Goal 8\. Did the artwork successfully evoke thought or challenge perceptions related to work and economic realities?  
* Willingness to experiment with the materials and techniques, embracing the unique qualities of Op Art, demonstrating problem-solving during the creative process.  
* Ability to articulate personal artistic choices and to interpret and provide thoughtful feedback on partner's artwork, connecting it to Global Goal 8 themes.  
* Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in revealing unseen complexities and advocating for decent work and economic growth.

**Introduction**

	Begin by asking, “How do you express your emotions when words aren’t enough?”

	Lead a brief discussion about how art, particularly expressionism, can be a powerful outlet for feelings and ideas. Examples of questions:

- Think of a time you were really happy, or really upset, but struggled to find the right words to say how you felt. What did you do instead? Maybe you listened to music, wrote in a journal, or even just went for a run. Today, we’re going to explore how art can be a powerful way to express emotions that are hard to put into words or talk about.

	Ask students for examples of how they express themselves without words. Expect things like:

- Music choices
- Body language/facial expressions
- Doodles or drawings
- Fashion choices
- Actions (slamming a door, daydreaming, etc.)

	Introduce and explain Expressionism, “Artists have been doing this for centuries. There’s a whole movement called Expressionism where the goal is to show strong emotions directly, not just paint a pretty picture. Think bold colors, distorted shapes, anything that makes you feel something when you look at it.”

	Re-introduce Global Goal 5 (if necessary), “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”	

	Explain how Expressionist art, with its focus on raw emotion and subjective experience, can help us understand and communicate with complexities of gender inequality.

- “Imagine you’re feeling frustrated beacuase you’re treated differently just because of your gender. Maybe you’re told you can’t do something, or you see someone else being treated unfairly. How would you paint that feeling/ Would it be bright and cheerful, or something else?”

	Key points about Expressionism

- *Not about being "good" at drawing/painting*: It's about what the art *communicates*. A simple scribble can be powerful if it captures the emotion.
- *Subjectivity is key*: There's no one "right" way to express anger, joy, etc. Each artist (and each of you) will do it differently. This mirrors the diverse experiences of gender inequality.
- *Breaking the Mold*: Expressionism often breaks the rules of traditional art. This can represent breaking free from societal expectations and norms, just like fighting for gender equality.

	Show examples of Expressionist artworks:

[Woman with Dead Child](https://www.kollwitz.de/en/woman-with-dead-child-kn-81), Käthe Kollwitz

	This heart-wrenching image conveys the grief and despair of a mother who has lost her child, potentially due to lack of access to healthcare, a consequence of gender inequality.

		[Street, Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street,_Berlin_
(Kirchner)), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner

		This bustling street scene, with its angular figures and jarring colors, can represent the feeling of being marginalized or objectified, a common experience for women in many societies.

		[Mother and Child](https://onlinecollection.leopoldmuseum.org/en/object/651-mother-and-child/), Egon Schiele

		This painting depicts a mother and child in a tender embrace, but the distorted figures and somber colors also suggest vulnerability and the challenges faced by mothers, particularly in contexts where maternal health care is inadequate.

		[The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream), Edvard Munch

		While not explicitly about gender, the raw emotion and anxiety conveyed in this iconic painting can resonate with anyone who has felt silenced or oppressed, linking it to the fight against gender-based discrimination.

		[Twins](https://www.wikiart.org/en/marianne-von-werefkin/me8ezlkayfe), Marianee von Werefkin

		While the women appear somewhat melancholic, they also exude a quiet strength and dignity. This can symbolize the resilience of women in the face of discrimination and inequality, and their ability to find power and connection even in challenging circumstances.
		[The Mad Woman](https://useum.org/artwork/Mad-Woman-Chaim-Soutine-1920), Chaim Soutine

		This piece could prompt a discussion on the historical and ongoing mistreatment of women's mental health. The woman's exaggerated expression and contorted posture may represent the societal dismissal and misunderstanding of women's emotional and psychological experiences. This can lead to conversations about breaking stigma, advocating for accessible mental health care, and empowering women to take control of their well-being, all crucial steps towards achieving gender equality.
**Emotion and Target Connection**

	Students can work alone or in small groups, each assigned a different Global Goal 5 Target.

	Each student or group identifies 2-3 emotions strongly linked to their Target’s challenge.

	Examples:

- *Target 5.1 - Discrimination Against Women:* Frustration, injustice, defiance.
- *Target 5.2 - Violence Against Women:* Fear, anger, isolation.
- *Target 5.3 - Eliminate Harmful Practices:* Helplessness, trauma, resilience.
- *Target 5.4 - Recognize Unpaid Care and Work:* Exhaustion, undervaluation, determination
- *Target 5.5 - Women’s Participation and Opportunities:* Ambition, frustration, empowerment
- *Target 5.6 - Universal Access and Rights:* Hope, autonomy, vulnerability
- *Target 5.a - Economic Resources:* Determination, inequality, progress
- *Target 5.b - Tech for Empowerment:* Curiosity, connection, empowerment
- *Target 5.c - Policies for Gender Equality:* Justice, solidarity, change

For each emotion, brainstorm corresponding art elements. Examples/prompts:

- *Target 5.1:*
  - *Frustration:* Clenched fists, sharp lines, chaotic composition, contrasting colors
  - *Injustice:* Unbalanced scales, tilted horizons, muted or grayscale colors
  - *Defiance:* Upright postures, raised fists, bold colors, powerful imagery
- *Target 5.2:*
  - *Fear:* Jagged lines, dark colors, distorted figures.
  - *Anger:* Bold brushstrokes, contrasting colors, sharp shapes.
  - *Isolation:* Empty space, cool colors, lone figure.
- *Target 5.3:*
  - *Helplessness:* Bound figures, drooping postures, chains or restraints
  - *Trauma:* Fragmented images, muted colors, obscured faces
  - *Resilience:* Unyielding gaze, vibrant colors emerging from darkness, symbols of growth or healing
- *Target 5.4:*
  - *Exhaustion:* Repetitive patterns, drooping figures, muted colors
  - *Undervaluation:* Small or hidden figures, domestic scenes in the background, overshadowed by other elements
  - *Determination:* Strong lines, focused expressions, tools or objects representing domestic work held proudly
- *Target 5.5:*
  - *Ambition:* Upward reaching figures, bright colors, open spaces
  - *Frustration:* Blocked pathways, glass ceilings, confined spaces
  - *Empowerment:* Confident postures, symbols of leadership, breaking chains or barriers
- *Target 5.6:*
  - *Hope:* Blooming flowers, sunrise colors, figures embracing or supporting each other
  - *Autonomy:* Confident expressions, open postures, images of choice and control
  - *Vulnerability:* Delicate lines, soft colors, figures seeking protection or information
- *Target 5.a:*
  - *Determination:* Unyielding gaze, strong hands holding tools or resources, forward movement
  - *Inequality:* Uneven distribution of resources, contrasting images of wealth and poverty, divided landscapes
  - *Progress:* Ascending lines, growing plants, figures stepping over obstacles
- *Target 5.b:*
  - *Curiosity:* Figures exploring technology, bright colors, open books or screens
  - *Connection:* Networks of lines or figures, communication symbols, global imagery
  - *Empowerment:* Confident figures using technology, tools, or symbols of knowledge
- *Target 5.c:*
  - *Justice:* Balanced scales, harmonious composition, figures standing together
  - *Solidarity:* Linked arms, group portraits, diverse figures united
  - *Change:* Movement, transformation, breaking chains or barriers, light emerging from darkness

**Expressive Creation: Emotions on Canvas**

	Each student creates their own Expressionist piece reflecting their assigned target’s emotions.

	Emphasize there’s no need for realistic representation. It’s about translating feelings onto the canvas/paper.

	Circulate, encouraging experimentation and asking questions like:

- What does this color represent to you?
- How does this line show the emotion you’re trying to convey?
- Can you tell me more about the symbolism you’re using in your piece?
- How does the texture of your materials reflect the emotions you’re trying to express?
- What would you like the viewer to feel or think when they see your artwork?
- Are there any specific elements in your piece that represent your personal connection to this issue?
- How does your artwork inspire hope or action for change?

**Gallery Walk and Empathy**

	Display student works in whatever way works best for the class (on the wall, laying on desks/tables, etc.)

	Students walk around for a “silent viewing”, observing each other’s work without talking.

	Each student will pick one piece (not their own) that speaks to them emotionally.

	Students will return to their desks/places to share the piece they have picked, and explain why to the class. Examples of questions/prompts for sharing:

- What drew you to this particular piece? What emotions did it stir in you?
- "Can you explain how the artist's use of color or form impacted you?"
- "Does this artwork remind you of any personal experiences or observations related to gender equality?"
- "In what ways does this artwork challenge or expand your understanding of the issue?"

	After everyone has shared, open a discussion. Example questions:

- "What common visual elements or symbols did you notice across different artworks, even those representing different targets?"
- "Did any artworks surprise you or challenge your preconceived notions about gender inequality?"
- "How did viewing the artwork collectively affect your understanding of the interconnectedness of the different Global Goal 5 targets?"
- "What role do you think art can play in raising awareness and inspiring action towards achieving gender equality?"
- "What specific actions or changes can we, as individuals and as a community, take to address the issues highlighted in the artwork?"



**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using the style of Expressionist art, with its emphasis on raw emotion, help you connect with the challenges and experiences related to gender inequality?
- What emotions did you explore and express in your artwork? How did you translate those feelings into visual elements like color, line, and composition?
- Did the process of creating your artwork help you understand the complexities of Global Goal 5 on a deeper level?
- How did the act of expressing your emotions through art differ from expressing them through words? What are the unique strengths of each?
- What did you learn about the power of art to communicate feelings and ideas that may be difficult to articulate directly?
- How did your chosen emotions and visual elements connect to the specific challenges and injustices addressed by Global Goal 5?
  What did you learn about the diverse range of issues encompassed by gender equality through the artwork created by your classmates?
- Did any of the artworks evoke a sense of hope or resilience in the face of gender inequality? How did your classmates convey those emotions?
- Did creating your artwork spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences or observations related to gender equality?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in advocating for gender equality and empowering women and girls?
- What did you learn about the importance of empathy and understanding when considering the experiences of others facing gender-based discrimination?

## **Dancing Our Story For Clean Water**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials**

Open space for movement

Audio

Video

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

[Optional] Props, blue scarves or fabric to represent water, small containers to symbolize water collection, etc.

**Introduction**

Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 6, Clean Water and Sanitation.

Clarify that Global Goal 6 means everyone, everywhere, has acces to clean water for drinking, washing, and playing, and safe ways to keep our environments clean (like good restrooms and trash disposal). Emphasize that this means healthy rivers, lakes, and oceans, and clean hands for all.

Explain to students that water has many "voices". Sometimes it's calm, sometimes it's rushing, sometimes it's still, and sometimes it's dirty. Discuss how they will use their bodies to tell stories about water's voice and how we can all work together to keep it clean. 

Introduce the idea of movement choirs. This is where a group of people create a unified performance through synchronized movements and gestures, often incorporating sounds or simple vocalizations. Explain that it is similar to a chorus, but instead of singing, everyone uses their bodies and movement to express ideas and emotions, and today, those will be about water and Global Goal 6!

If desired, show a short, age-appropriate video example of a simple movement choir. Focus on the idea of many bodies creating one message.

Examples:

- [Movement Choir - Matter Dance Company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw0VF1Lmk6U)
- [Matter Dance Company Take 2 - Movement Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQwftKTxSR8)

Remind students that no prior dance experience is required; everyone can participate and contribute their own movement style.

**Warm Up: Water Drops to Wave**

Explain that the class will explore how water moves, from tiny drops to big waves. Instruct students to stand in a comfortable position and space, and close their eyes gently if comfortable.

[Optional] Play soft, calm, flowing music during this warm up.

Song Examples:

- [Blue Planet II - Hans Zimmer, Jacob Shea & David Fleming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AerfAqrw7qY)
- [Opening - Philip Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nBE9U7q1Uc)
- [Morning Mood - Edvard Grieg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rh8gMvzPw0)
- [Promise - Secret Garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Yd6KluSEk)

*Tiny Drops*

- Instruct students to imagine water gently dripping. Have them make a tiny, quiet movement with just one finger, like a single droplet falling. 
- Then, have them make their fingers "drip" softly.
- Ask: How does it feel when your movement is small and precise?
- Guide students to make small, isolated finger movements, maybe light tapping sounds.

*Trickle and Flow*

- Instruct students to imagine many drops forming a trickle, then a gentle stream. Have them let that movement flow up their wrist, then their arm.
- Ask: How does it feel when your arm moves smoothly and continuously, like flowing water?
- Guide students to make fluid, continuous arm movements, adding soft trickling sounds.

*Rushing River*

- Instruct students to imagine that stream becoming a rushing river. Have them let that flow fill their whole body.
- Ask: How does it feel when your body moves with more energy and power, like a strong river current?
- Guide students to make larger, more energetic, but still controlled, full-body movements.

*Crashing Waves*

- Instruct students to imagine becoming a mighty wave, crashing onto the shore. Have them make a big, powerful movement with their whole body, then slowly draw back like the water.
- Ask: How does it feel to be powerful and then calm?
- Guide students through a large, energetic wave motion, then a slow, receding movement.

Conclude the warm up by affirming the exploration of water's motions.

**Our Water Story Dances**

Explain that the class will create a Movement Brainstorm about water's journey to plan the upcoming movement choir dances. They will think about a journey water takes - from clean to dirty, or from scarce to abundant - and then brainstorm specific movements, feelings, and group shapes for each part of the story.

On the board/paper, draw a simple, winding path or a timeline. Label key points along the path: *Sparkling Start, Challenges, Helping Hands, Clear Future.*

- *Sparkling Start*
  - Ask: What movements, feelings, or group shapes would show water that is perfectly clean, fresh, and abundant? Think about how that kind of water moves.

    Examples

    - Light, flowing, joyful, open, expansive shapes, clear, bright expressions, a wide open circle formation, gentle swaying, smooth turns.
  - Write these ideas under Sparkling Start.
- *Challenges*
  - Ask: Now, what movements, feelings, or group shapes would show water that is dirty, polluted, or hard to find? How would your body move if water was scarce or unhealthy?

    Examples

    - Heavy, sluggish, restricted movements, tangled/messy/constricted group shapes	, sad/worried/frustrated faces, slow dragging steps, miming coughing or holding nose, tight huddled formations, movements that show searching or thirst.
  - Write these ideas under Challenges.
- *Helping Hands*
  - Ask: What movements, feelings, or group shapes would show people working together to help water get clean, or to get clean water to others? What does it look like when we take action?

    Examples

    - Strong/determined/pushing and pulling movements, reaching out, miming cleaning/filtering/building, groups forming lines or supportive bridges, focused expressions, steady purposeful steps, movements that show sharing or lifting.
  - Write these ideas under Helping Hands.
- *Clear Future*
  - Ask: What movements, feeligns or group shapes would show the world when the water is clean and clear again, and everyone has what they need? What does that happy future feel like?

    Examples

    - Light/free/celebratory movements, open expansive formations, joyful relieved faces, dancing, jumping, spinning, a wide flowing circle, movements that show abundance and health.
- Write these ideas under Clear Future.

Summarize that this movement map has given us some great ideas for the movement choirs.

**Movement Choir Creation**

Divide students into small groups (4-8 students per group).

Explain that each student will create a short dance/movement choir (about 1-2 minutes long) based on a water story from the brainstorm. Emphasize that their dance should clearly show a beginning (Sparkling Start/Challenges), Middle (Helping Hands), and end (Clear Future).

Assign each group a "core water theme" for their dance, which are broad categories covering Global Goal 6.

These themes are:

- *The Pollution Story:* Focused on showing dirty water and cleaning it up.
- *The Water Access Story:* Focused on showing challenges getting water and people then gaining access to clean water.
- *The Hygiene Story:* Focused on showing challenges with cleanliness and people practicing good hygiene.
- *The Water Saving Story:* Focused on showing water scarcity and people learning to save and use water wisely.

Assign these themes to ensure all aspects of Global Goal 6 are explored across the class (leave any out that you feel are not a good fit for your students), and feel free to give more than one group the same theme.

Instruct the groups to use their brainstormed ideas to develop the sequence.

All groups will utilize the same fun, inspiring, teacher-provided music for their movement choir dance. Play the chosen music during their creation time. You can choose to play the entire track, or cue specific sections at certain times.

Music Examples:

- [Eye of The Tiger, Instrumental - Survivor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrGh2Wq7_Ro)
- [The Man, Instrumental - The Killers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cunwaFJqMKQ)
- [1901, Instrumental - Phoenix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVleXwwswJ4)
- [Pride (In the Name of Love), Instrumental - U2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5IesD4JJoU)
- [As It Was, Instrumental - Harry Styles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP-93Mtt3Cc)
- [Here Comes the Sun, Instrumental - The Beatles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubFFDJKeVlY)

Encourage groups to think about:

- *Unified Movement:* How can they move together in some parts (like a chorus), showing everyone working as one?
- *Expressive Gestures:* What simple body language and facial expressions can show emotions like sadness, determination, or joy?
- *Group Shapes/Formations:* How can their group physically change shape to show the problem (e.g., a tangled knot for pollution, a huddled group for scarcity0 and the solution (e.g., an open, flowing circle for clean water, a strong, upright line for access)?
- *Simple Actions:* What everyday actions (like miming washing hands, scooping water, clearing trash, turning off a faucet) can they make bigger and more expressive through dance?
- [Optional] *Using Props:* how can scarves, etc. add to their story?
- *Listening to the music:* How does the upbeat, inspiring music help them show hope and positive change?

Provide groups with musical cues dependent on the music chosen for the class (e.g., 20 seconds for the start/problem, 30 seconds for action, 30 seconds for solution) to structure their piece.

Circulate among groups, offering guidance and encouragement. Ask guiding questions like:

- How are you showing the dirty feeling with your movements in the beginning? What kind of body shape shows that?
- What kind of teamwork can you show in the action part? How do your bodies connect?
- How does your group shape change to show clean water at the end? Does it feel light and free?
- Are you showing clear emotions on your face as you move, from worried to hopeful?
- What unique gesture can your group create that means clean water or helping hands?

**Performance Showcase**

Gather the class. Remind the audience to observe carefully, looking for emotions, actions, and the story being told through movement.

Each group will perform, first introducing their water theme (e.g., "We will show The Pollution Story".

After each performance, invite the audience to share. Ask guiding questions like:

- What was the water problem you saw in their dance's beginning?
- What actions did you see them take in the middle to make things better?
- What did their dance look like at the end? What was the solution?
- What emotions did their dance make you feel?

After discussion, invite the performing group to briefly explain their artistic choices.

**Reflection & Summary** 

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did dancing a story about water help you understand Global Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation in a new way?
- What did you learn about the importance of clean water and why it's a big promise for everyone in the world?
- Which movements or ideas from this activity (both the brainstorming and the dancing) made you think or feel the most about clean water, and why?
- What does this activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 6?
- What's one small action you feel inspired to take this week to help keep water clean or save water?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, movement choir creation, and class discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of clean water and sanitation (access, hygiene, pollution prevention), as demonstrated through the symbolism, emotions, and message in the movement choir piece and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying chosen movement choir elements (e.g., synchoronized movements, expressive gestures, use of level/space, simple vocalizations/sounds) to convey the message about water and sanitation. Look for clear effort in expressing the feeling and concept through dance and movement.
- Ability to work effectively within small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively to create and perform the movement choir dance. This includes the attempt to achieve synchronization and unified expression.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

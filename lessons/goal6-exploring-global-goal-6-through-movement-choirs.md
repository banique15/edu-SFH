Open space for movement

Audio

Video

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

[Optional] Props, blue scarves or fabric to represent water, small containers to symbolize water collection, etc.

**Introduction**
**\
`	`Start by asking students, How does water make you feel?

`	`Allow a few moments of quiet reflection, then invite them to share their thoughts and feelings with the class.

`	`Briefly explain the concept of movement choirs, where a group of people create a unified performance through synchroized movements and gestures, often incorporating spoken word or vocalization.

- Simple Explanation: Imagine a group of people moving together, like a chorus, but instead of singing they're using their bodies to express ideas and emotions. That's the essence of a movement choir.
- Key Features
  - *Synchronized Movement:* Everyone moves together, creating a sense of unity and shared purpose.
  - *Expressive Gestures:* Using body language and facial expressions to convey emotions and ideas.
  - *Spoken Word or Vocalization:* Sometimes, words or sounds are incorporated to add another layer of meaning.
  - *Accessibility:* No prior dance experience is required; anyone can participate and contribute their own movement style.

`	`Re-introduce Global Goal 6 if necessary: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

`	`Highlight the importance of water for human health, ecosystems, and the planet's well-being.

- *Human Health:* Hydration, hygiene, sanitation, growing food.
- *Ecosystems:* Supporting diverse plant and animal life, maintaining natural balance.
- *The Planet:* Regulating climate, shaping landscapes, providing resources for industries and communities.

`	`Connect this to student's lives, asking questions to make it personal, such as:

- How much water do you think you use in a day? Where does it come from?
- Can you imagine life without clean water to drink or wash with?
- How do you think water pollution affects the environment and the creatures that live in it?

`	`Explain how movement choirs can be a powerful tool for expressing the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with water-related issues.

- *Emotional Connection,* movement choirs can help us:
  - Express the emotions associated with water issues - joy, gratitude, anger, fear, hope.
  - Embody the challenges of water scarcity or pollution through movement.
  - Envision solutions and express the power of collective action through synchronized movement and collaborative choreography.
  - Imagine a group of people moving like a flowing river, representing the abundance and life-giving properties of water. Or, picture them huddled together, their bodies tense and constricted, symbolizing the struggle for access to clean water in a drought-striken region.

**Warm-Up: Water's Motions**
**\
`	`Lead students through a series of guided movements that explore different qualities of water.

- *Flowing:* Smooth, continuous movements like waves or currents.
- *Stagnant:* Stillness, holding poses, or slow, controlled movements.
- *Turbulent:* Chaotic, energetic movements, representing storms or floods.
- *Cleansing:* Gentle, repetitive motions like washing hands or collecting water.

`	`[Optional] Encourage students to experiment with sounds that represent water.

- Dripping, trickling, flowing
- Rain, storms, ocean waves
- Whispers, murmurs, or chants

`	`Guide students to connect specific movements (and sounds) to emotions related to water.

- Joy and gratitude for clean water
- Anxiety and fear during droughts or floods
- Determination and hope in the face of water scarcity

**Movement Choir Creation**
**\
`	`Divide students into groups of 4-8. Assign each group one of the Global Goal 6 targets.

`	`Give each group a simplified version of Global Goal 6 targets.

`	`Help students understand the challenge facing their goal/target, asking questions such as:

- What's the problem this goal/target is trying to solve? Who's affected? Where in the world is this happening?

`	`Lead students through a movement (and sound) brainstorm, asking leading questions such as:

- What body shapes/actions show this struggle (e.g., hunched over for water scarcity, frantic scrubbing for pollution)
- Are there any literal gestures? (e.g., turning a faucet, washing hands)

  If utilizing sound

- What sounds represent this issue? (e.g., dripping for leaks, machinery for industrial pollution)
- Can voices by used? (e.g., whispers for lack of access, chants for protest)

`	`Guide groups to think about how the movement (and sound) can change to show progress towards the target.

**Choreography and Rehearsal**

`	`Suggest a simple structure

- Beginning (problem)
- Middle (struggle/action)
- End (solution/hope)

`	`Communicate to students that the movement choir choreography should be 1-2 minutes long, so key moments should be prioritized.

`	`Help students focus on movement elements, such as:

- *Unison vs. Contrast*
  - Some parts can be everyone doing the same thing, others can have subgroups doing different but complementary movements to show complexity.
- *Spatial Patterns*
  - Circles can show community, lines can show journeys, clusters can represent crowding/lack of resources.
- *Facial Expressions*
  - These are essential in conveying emotion without words.
\*\
`		`If using sound integration

- *Vocalizations*
  - Can be literal words, chants, or abstract sounds to create atmosphere.

`	`During choreography creation, remind students that the goal is expression, not perfection.
\*\
`	`Example Prompts

- *6.1 - Access to Water*
  - *Start:* Group huddled low, hands cupped as if thirsty.
  - *Middle:* Frantic searching, maybe someone collapses from exhaustion.
  - *End:* Eruption of joy as "water" is found/brought in, shared with relief.
- *6.2 - Sanitation*
  - *Start:* Chaotic movement, covering noses, showing discomfort.
  - *Middle:* Orderly lines forming, miming handwashing, building a latrine.
  - *End:* Proud stances, clean faces, maybe a "tableau" of a healthy community.
- *6.3 - Water Quality*
  - *Start:* Slow, sluggish movements, showing contamination.
  - *Middle:* Energetic scrubbing, filtering motions, purifying the "water".
  - *End:* Flowing, joyful movements, mirroring clean water, maybe bird sounds added vocally (if using sound).
- *6.4 - Water Efficiency*
  - *Start:* Restricted, tight movements, showing scarcity, maybe a "plant" wilting.
  - *Middle:* Careful, precise gestures of collecting/conserving (cupped hands, small steps).
  - *End:* Growth! Plant revives, movements become more expansive, showing abundance achieved through mindful use.
- *6.5 - Integrated Water Management*
  - *Start:* Groups facing off, tense postures, maybe conflicted sounds/chants (if using sound).
  - *Middle:* Negotiation, coming together, forming a circle or linked shape.
  - *End:* Harmonious movement, all contributed to a shared goals (e.g., building something together).
- *6.6 - Ecosystems*
  - *Start:* Disjointed, chaotic movements, represented a damaged ecosystem.
  - *Middle:* Nurturing gestures, planting, cleaning, protecting.
  - *End:* Flourishing, interconnected movements, representing a restored ecosystem.
- *6.a - International Cooperation*
  - *Start:* Isolated groups, showing need but unable to help each other.
  - *Middle:* Reaching out, connecting, sharing of resources.
  - *End:* Unified movement, showing the strength of collaboration.
- *6.b - Community Participation*
  - *Start:* Individual movements, showing lack of unity.
  - *Middle:* Coming together, forming a group, raising voices (literally or through movement).
  - *End:* Powerful, collective movement, demonstrating community strength.

**Performance Showcase and Reflection**

`	`Create a supportive and respectful atmosphere for performances. Dim lights or use simple staging if possible to enhance the experience.

`	`Have each group introduce their target and/or briefly explain their choreographic choices before performing.

`	`Encourage the audience to focus on the movements, emotions, and sounds (if applicable) conveyed in each piece.

`	`After all groups have performed, facilitate a group discussion about the performances with questions such as:

- How did each group's movements (and sounds) represent the assigned goal/target?
- What emotions did the performances evoke?
- How did the experience of creating and performing the movement choir deepen your understanding of Global Goal 6?
- Can you identify specific moments in the choreography that resonated with the challenges or solutions related to the goal/target?
- Were there any particularly creative or symbolic gestures that stood out to you?\
  Did any specific movements (or sounds) trigger a strong emotional response?
- How did the choreography create a particular mood or atmosphere?
- Did any of the performances make you reflect on your own water usage or habits?
- How can we, as individuals and as a global community, contribute to achieving the goals of Global Goal 6?
- In what ways can creative expression, like movement choirs, help raise awareness and inspire action around environmental issues?



**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using your bodies to express the challenges and solutions related to clean water and sanitation make you feel?
- Did any particular movements or gestures evoke strong emotions in you? Can you describe them?
- Did the physical act of creating and performing the movement choir help you connect with the issue on a deeper level? If so, how?
- What new insights or understandings did you gain about the complexities of Global Goal 6 through this activity?
- Did any of the performances challenge your preconceptions or assumptions about water and sanitation issues?
- How did seeing different groups interpret the same goal through movement broaden your perspective on the issue?
- How can we use our bodies and voices to express our concerns about water and sanitation challenges?
- Beyond dance and movement, what are other creative ways we can use our bodies and voices to raise awareness and advocate for change?

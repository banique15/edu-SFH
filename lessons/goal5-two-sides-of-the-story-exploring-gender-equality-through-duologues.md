**Introduction**

*   Divide the class into pairs.
*   Explain “Today, we’re diving into Global Goal 5: Gender Equality. But first, let’s warm up our communication and empathy muscles.”
*   Present the list of relatable topics, emphasizing that even seemingly simple issues can have multiple perspectives.
*   Provide a list of relatable topics that resonate with teenagers, such as:

    - School uniforms, pro vs. con
    - Homework, necessary vs. unnecessary
    - Cell phones in class, allowed vs. banned
    - Social media, positive impact vs. negative impact
    - Curfew, necessary for safety vs. restriction of freedom
    - Climate change, individual responsibility vs. government action

*   Have each pair randomly select, choose their own topic from the list, or assign their topics as is best for the class.
*   Assign each student in the pair one of the opposing viewpoints.
*   Encourage them to step into the shoes of someone who holds that view, even if it’s different from their own.
*   Give them a few minutes to brainstorm arguments and consider the potential motivations and concerns of someone with that perspective.
*   Initiate the dialoge, reminding students to:

    - Actively listen to their partner and try to understand their reasoning.
    - Ask questions to clarify their partner’s perspective.
    - Express their own viewpoint clearly and respectfully.
    - Look for areas of common ground or potential compromise.

*   Before students begin, ask them to think about how gender might influence someone’s opinion on their topic. Would it change the arguments they’d make or their priorities?
*   Example dialogue prompts:

    - *School Uniforms*
      - I believe school uniforms promote equality and reduce distractions.
      - I think school uniforms stifle individuality and self-expression.
    - *Homework*
      - Homework helps us practice and understand what we’re learning.
      - Homework is just extra work, and it takes away from the time we could spend learning other things
    - *Cell Phones*
      - Cell phones can be helpful for research and emergencies, as long as we use them responsibly.
      - Cell phones are too tempting; they’ll just lead to us being off-task and not learning.
    - *Social Media*
      - Social media connects us with people all over the world and helps us stay informed.
      - Social media can be addictive and lead to cyberbullying and unrealistic comparisons.
    - *Curfew*
      - Curfews protect us from danger at night when we’re more vulnerable.
      - Curfews treat us like kids and stop us from having any independence.
    - *Climate Change*
      - Individual actions like recycling and reducing energy consumption are crucial for combating climate change.
      - Government policies and regulations are necessary to address the systemic causes of climate change.

*   Facilitate a whole-class discussion after the dialoges, asking questions such as:

    - How did it feel to argue for a viewpoint you might not personally agree with?
    - What were some of the challenges or surprises you encountered during the conversation?
    - Did you notice any assumptions about gender roles or expectations come up in your dialogues, even on topics not directly about gender?
    - What strategies did you use to try to understand your partner’s perspective? (active listening, asking questions, paraphrasing, etc.)
    - Did you find any common ground or areas of agreement, even though you started with opposing viewpoints?
    - Just like in these debates, gender equality issues have multiple sides. How can the skills we practiced here (listening, questioning, etc.) help us have productive conversations about these complex topics?
    - What are the potential consequences of not listening to and respecting diverse viewpoints?

**Character Creation: Two Sides of the Coin**

*   Each pair receives a Global Goal 5 Target.
*   The pairs each brainstorm two characters directly affected by the Target, but with different viewpoints or experiences. Examples:

    - *Target 5.1 - (Ending Discrimination)*
      - Character 1: A transgender student who faces discrimination and bullying at school due to their gender identity.

    - *Target 5.2 - (Eliminating Violence Against Women)*
      - Character 1: A young woman who experiences sexual harassment on public transportation and feels powerless to speak up.
      - Character 2: A bystander who witnesses the harassment but is unsure how to intervene.

      - Character 1: A woman entrepreneur struggling to secure funding for her business due to gender bias in the financial sector.
      - Character 2: A bank loan officer who adheres to traditional lending practices and is hesitant to invest in women-led businesses.
    - *Target 5.6 - (Reproductive Health)*
      - *Character 1:* A young woman in a conservative community who faces judgment and stigma for seeking access to contraception or abortion services.
      - *Character 2:* A healthcare provider in the same community who feels torn between their personal beliefs and their professional obligation to provide comprehensive reproductive healthcare.
    - *Target 5.b - (Technology and Empowerment)*

*   Encourage students to explore:

    - Are the characters teenagers, young adults, or older individuals?
    - What are their cultural, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds?
    - What drives each character’s beliefs and actions?
    - How do the characters know each other? What is the dynamic between them?

**Duologue Writing: Conflict and Connection**

*   Pairs write a short script (1-2 pages) featuring a conversation between their two characters.
*   Have each pair start by brainstorming the setting of their conversation. This could be a workplace, a home, a school, or any other relevant location.
*   Encourage students to identify the central point of tension or disagreement between their two characters. This conflict should stem from the challenges associated with their assigned Global Goal 5 Target.
*   Remind students to use dialogue and action to reveal their characters’ personalities, motivations, and emotions, rather than simply stating their viewpoints.
*   While showcasing contrasting perspectives, also encourage students to include moments of empathy, understanding, or attempts at compromise. This adds depth and realism to the conversation.
*   The ending of the dialoge doesn’t have to be neatly resolved. It can leave the audience with questions or possibilities for further exploration.
*   Example dialogue prompts:

    - *Target 5.1*
      - Scenario: A female student is constantly interrupted and talked over by her male classmates during group projects. She confronts one of them about it.

**Introduction**

Begin with a clear and engaging introduction to documentary theater.

- Documentary theater is a form of theare that uses real-world source materials, such as interviews, transcripts, news reports, and historical documents, to create a theatrical performance. It aims to explore real events and issues, often with a focus on social or political themes. 
- While it can be fully staged, it’s also powerful in a simple reading format, where the focus is on the words and the voices.

Give examples of documentary theater plays or techniques:

- “The Laramie Project”
  - The play centers on the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, which sparked national outrage and intense media scrutiny on Laramie.
  - The play’s core is built upon over 200 interviews conducted with Laramie residents, including those who knew Shepard, law enforcement officials, and members of the community.
  - The play explores various themes, including the complexities of prejudice, the impact of violence, the search for understanding, and the struggle for justice in the face of hate.
- “The Investigation”
  - The play directly confronts the horrors of the Holocaust. It is based on the actual transcripts and evidence presented at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials (1963-1965), where former SS officers and other personnel involved in the operation of the Auschwitz concentration camp were tried.
  - The play is structured as a courtroom drama, featuring witnesses, defendants, and legal personnel.
  - The play explores several profound and disturbing themes, including the nature of evil, the importance of listening to and remembering the testimonies of survivors, the power of language, collective guilt and responsibility, and the limits of justice.
- “The Living Newspapers”
  - The Living Newspapers were a unique theatrical form that emerged from the Federal theater Project, a program of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during the Great Depression in the 1930s in the United States. The FTP aimed to provide employment for unemployed theater professionals.
  - These plays were created in response to the pressing social, political, and economic issues of the time, such as poverty, unemployment, housing crises, and agricultural problems. They sought to inform and engage a broad audience.
  - The plays were heavily based on factual information gathered from newspapers, government reports, statistics, and other sources. They often aimed to show various viewpoints on an issue, representing different social classes, political positions, and affected individuals.
  - The Living Newspapers explored a wide range of themes relevant to the 1930s, including economic inequality, labor rights, government policies, public health, and energy and resources.

Facilitate a brief discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are you initial thoughts on using real-life events as the basis for a play?
- What are the advantages of focusing on the words and voices in a table read?
- How can documentary theater raise awareness and promote social change?

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for life on Earth.

Provide a holistic overview of the goal, highlighting key themes:

- The beauty and diversity of life on land.
- The essential services provided by ecosystems.
- The threats to these ecosystems (deforestation, habitat loss, etc.).
- The urgency of conservation and sustainable practices.

Engage students in a thought-provoking discussion about how documentary theater can be used to explore themes related to Global Goal 15.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use real-life stories and information to create a powerful theatrical experience about life on land, even in a simple reading?
- Can a table read help us focus on the language and the different voices involved in environmental issues?
- How can we use vocal expression and tone to convey the emotional impact of these issues?

**Script Work and Table Read**

Distribute copies of the provided flexible script (or a unique, self written script) to all students.

Explain that the script is designed to be adaptable and can be performed as a table read, with students reading their parts.

Assign roles to students, ensuring that everyone has a chance to participate.

Emphasize that all roles are important and that everyone contributes to the overall story. Students can rotate roles if time allows.

The class reads through the script, each to themselves. Focus on:

- Identifying the different voices and perspectives presented.
- Understanding the factual information and data included.
- Recognizing the theatrical elements (e.g., dialogue, stage directions, shifts in tone).
- Connecting the script to the targets and themes of Global Goal 15.

The class performs the script as a table read. Emphasize:

- Clear and expressive delivery of lines.
- Varying vocal tones and rhythms to distinguish characters.
- Paying attention to the emotional content of the lines.
- Collaborative reading, with students listening and responding to each other.

You can

- Direct students on how to portray their characters with their voices.
- Suggest ways to use pauses and emphasis.
- Help students find the emotional core of the script.
- Encourage students to make the script their own through vocal interpretation.

**Post-Read Discussion**

Facilitate a class discussion about the table read and its connection to Global Goal 15. Pose questions like:

- What were the most important issues raised in the play?
- Which characters or perspectives resonated with you most strongly?
- How did the table read format affect your understanding of the play?
- What did you learn about the challenges and solutions related to protecting life on land?
- How can documentary theater, even in a simple reading, raise awareness and promote change?



**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did performing a documentary theater table read, using different voices and perspectives, help you understand the complexities of issues related to life on land?
- What did you learn abou the power of real-world narratives and factual information when presented through the medium of theater?
- Did hearing different “voices” (e.g., scientist, farmer, activist) through the script make you feel more empathetic towards individuals and communities impacted by land degradation or deforestation?
- How did focusing on vocal expression and tone in the table read affect your understanding of the characters’ experiences and emotions?
- What did you discover about how theater, even in a simple reading format, can bring abstract environmental issues to life?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 15 and the importance of protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems through this activity?
- How did specific scenarios and testimonies in the script illuminate the diverse challenges (e.g., deforestation, desertification, biodiversity loss) that Global Goal 15 aims to address?
- Did the play make you think differently about the interconnectedness of human actions and the health of terrestrial ecosystems?
- What common themes or urgent messages about life on land emerged across the different voices in the script?
- How does presenting real-world information through a theatrical lens help to advocate for the goals of sustainable land management?
- Did any particular character’s words or the overall narrative in the script resonate with you personally, perhaps sparking a new commitment to environmental protection?
- What emotions did you connect with during this lesson, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action for life on land?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in advocating for positive change for the environment?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including script exploration (individual reading), table read performance, and active participation in class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 themes (e.g., deforestation, desertification, biodiversity loss, conservation) as demonstrated through vocal interpretation of character perspectives and verbal explanations during discussion.
- Ability to use vocal elements (tone, pitch, volume, pacing, emphasis) to effectively distinguish characters, convey emotions, and communicate the factual or experiential content of the lines in the table read.
- How clearly and powerfully the collective table read communicated its intended message about Global Goal 15. Did the vocal performances successfully evoke thought or emotion related to life on land?
- Ability to work together as an ensemble, demonstrating active listening, responsive reading, and a collective effort to create a cohesive theatrical experience during the table read.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for environmental change and the complexities of conserving life on land.

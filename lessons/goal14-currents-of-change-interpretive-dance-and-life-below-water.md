**Introduction**

Begin with a clear explanation of interpretive dance. Explain that it is a style of dance where movement is used to express emotions, ideas, and stories. 

Emphasize that it is less about specific steps and more about using bodies to communicate.

Communicate to students the group will focus on exploring movement qualities, levels (high, medium, low), and spatial awareness to convey meaning.
Let the group know there are no right or wrong ways to move; that it is about expressing what you feel and understand.

Demonstrate simple example prompts:

- Show me with your body what “flowing” water looks like.
- How would you move to show something is “fragile”?
- Can you show” power” and “destruction” with your movements?

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the vital role of the oceans for life on Earth and the urgency of protecting them.

Provide a holistic overview of the challenges and importance of ocean conservation.

Examples:

- What does it mean to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans”?
- Highlight the ocean’s importance
  - The ocean is not just a big body of water. It’s essential for life on Earth.
  - It provides oxygen, regulates climate, supports biodiversity, and provides food and livelihoods for billions of people.
- Outline the major threats.
  - The ocean is facing many threats, and that’s what Global Goal 14 is trying to address.
  - Key areas of focus:
    - *Pollution:* Tons of plastic and chemicals are poured into the ocean, harming animals and ecosystems. (Connects to Target 14.1)
    - *Overfishing:* Fish are being taken out of the ocean faster than they can reproduce, disrupting the food chain. (Connects to Target 14.4)
    - *Climate Change:* The ocean is absorbing a lot of the heat from climate change, which is causing it to warm and become more acidic.
    - *Habitat Destruction:* Important habitats are being destroyed, like coral reefs and mangroves, which are home to many marine species. (Connects to Targets 14.2, 14.5)
  - Emphasize human dependence.
    - We rely on the ocean for food, jobs, transportation, and even recreation. (Connects to Target 14.7)
  - Focus on solutions.
    - We can do something about these problems. Goal 14 is about finding solutions to protect the ocean and use it sustainably.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What are some words or phrases that come to mind when you think about the ocean?
- What are some thing shumand do that help or harm the ocean?
- How can we use dance to tell the story of the ocean?

Connect interpretive dance and Global Goal 14 by engaging students in a discussion about how interpretive dance can be used to explore themes related to the ocean. Ask questions like:

- How can we use movement to represent the beauty and diversity of marine life?
- Can we show the impact of pollution or overfishing through dance?
- How can dance express our emotions about the ocean and inspire action?

**Guided Movement Exploration**

Guide the entire class through a series of movement explorations, using imagery and prompts related to the ocean.

Emphasize clear instructions, varied movement qualities, and inclusive language.

Examples of movement sequences:

- *Ocean currents:*
  - Let’s begin by exploring the movements of ocean currents. Imagine you are a current, flowing through the water. Start with small, gentle movements, like a ripple. Gradually expand your movements, becoming a powerful current. Show the different ways water moves - swirling, surging, flowing smoothly.
  - *Guide the class through variations in speed, direction, and intensity.*
- *Marine Life*
  - Let’s explore different forms of marine life. Imagine you are a jellyfish, pulsing gently through the water. Move with slow, graceful motions. Now, imagine you are a fast-moving fish, darting and changing direction quickly. Now, imagine you are a whale, moving with immense power and slow, deep breaths.
  - *Encourage students to explore different levels - low for creatures on the seabed, high for birds diving into the water, etc.*
- *The Impact of Pollution*
  - Imagine plastic waste entering the ocean. Start with flowing, open movements, then gradually constrict your movements, showing the entanglement and restriction caused by plastic. Show the struggle of marine life to move freely.
  - *Use contrasting movement qualities - flowing vs. jerky, free vs. restricted, etc.*
- *Overfishing*
  - Imagine a school of fish swimming together. Move in a group, showing unity and energy. Now, imagine a net capturing them. Show the confusion, panic, and loss of freedom. Show the emptiness left behind.
  - *Use spatial awareness to show the group dispersing and the space becoming empty.*
- *Ocean’s Resilience*
  - Imagine the power of a wave, crashing and reforming. Show the energy and renewal of the ocean. Use strong, expansive movements.
  - *Encourage students to find their own way to express strength and hope.*

Throughout the sequence:

- Provide clear and evocative instructions, taking ample time to move through each sequence.
- Demonstrate movement qualities and variations if necessary and able.
- Encourage students to explore an interpret the imagery in their own way.
- Create a safe and supportive environment for experimentation.

**Creative Movement Exploration**

After the guided sequences, facilitate a period of free movement exploration.

Invite students to:

- Reflect on the images and sensations they experienced during the guided movement.
- Explore their own movement responses to the themes of the ocean and its challenges.
- Move in a way that feels authentic and expressive.

Provide prompts or suggestions if needed/wanted.

Examples:

- How would you move to represent the beauty of a coral reef?
- Can you show the danger of plastic pollution through your movement?
- How can you express your hope for a healthy ocean?

**Cool-down and Discussion**

Lead a gentle cool-down to bring the energy back down and prepare for reflection.

Include stretching, deep breathing, and calming movements.

Facilitate a class discussion, asking guiding questions like:

- What was your experience with the interpretive dance exploration?
- Which movements or images were most powerful for you?
- How did the movement help you connect with the themes of global Goal 14?
- What did you learn abou tyour own capacity for expression and creativity?
- How can dance be a tool for raising awareness and inspiring action?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using interpretive dance - expressing ideas through movement - help you connect with the themes of ocean conservation and the challenges faced by life below water?
- What sensations or emotions did you experience in your body as you moved through the different visualizations related to the ocean’s beauty, its struggles, or its resilience?
- Did physically embodying concepts like marine pollution, overfishing, or habitat destruction offer you new insights that words alone might not have?
- What did you learn about the power of your body and imagination to explore complex global challenges without using words?
- How can connecting with these issues through movement make them feel more immediate, personal, or urgent?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 14 and the importance of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources through this dance exploration?
- How did the different movement sequences (e.g., ocean currents, marine life, impact of pollution) illuminate the diverse aspects of ocean health that Global Goal 14 addresses?
- Did the activity make you think differently about the interconnectedness of marine ecosystems and how human actions impact them?
- How does a holistic understanding of ocean conservation, as explored through movement, relate to the broader goals of a sustainable future?
- Did any particular movement sequence or visualization resonate with you on a personal level, perhaps, sparking a new commitment to ocean conservation?
- What emotions did you connect with during this dance activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 14?
- What is one key takeaway about ocean conservation and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in protecting life below water in your daily life or community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and mindful involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, guided movement explorations, creative movement exploration, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 14 themes (e.g., marine pollution, biodiversity loss, sustainable use) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in movement and verbal explanations during discussion.
- Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract concepts related to ocean health (e.g., pollution’s restriction, the flow of currents, marine life’s movement) into physical movement.
- How clearly and powerfully the movements communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 14. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the ocean?
- Willingness to experiment with and apply different movement qualities (e.g., flowing, sharp, heavy, light, expansive, constricted) to enhance the meaning of the interpretations.
- Nuance and insight demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of embodied learning in understanding global challenges and the complexities of ocean conservation.

## Five Lines of Unity: Poems for a Better World

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers


**Introduction**

`	`Begin by introducing the cinquain as a kind of poetry. Explain that it’s a short, five-line poem that follows a very specific structure based on the number of words in each line. The poem is a bit like a pyramid of words that builds on a single idea.

`	`Explain the structure:

- *Line 1:* One word (the main topic).
- *Line 2:* Two words (describing the topic).
- *Line 3:* Three words (an action related to the topic).
- *Line 4:* Four words (a feeling or a description of the action).
- *Line 5:* One word (a summary or another word for the topic).

`	`Share a simple example on the board, like:

`		`Friends

`		`Kind, loyal

`		`Laughing, playing games

`		`Always there to help

`		`Together

`	`Open a short discussion about cinquain and the example poem. Ask guiding questions like:

- What did you notice about the poem?
- How does each line build on the one before it?
- How does the final word tie the whole poem together?

`	`Next, introduce Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships. It means that for us to solve big problems like hunger or poverty, we have to work together as a team. Just like a cinquain is built one line at a time, a partnership is built one idea at a time, with everyone contributing.

**The Partnership Puzzle Brainstorm**

`	`Write the word “Partnership” on the whiteboard/paper.

`	`*What does a good partnership look like?*

`	`Prompt students to think about what a good partnership looks like, asking guiding questions like:

- What are two words that describe a good partnership?
- What does a partnership look like?

`	`Ask students to share their ideas, and write them on the board/paper.

`	`Examples of words that might be shared:

- Strong
- Vital
- United
- Global

`	`*What does a good partnership do?*

`	`Prompt students to think about what a good partnership does, asking guiding questions like:

- What are some action words that show what a partnership does?
- What do people do in a partnership?

`	`Ask students to share their ideas, and write them on the board/paper.

`	`Examples of words that might be shared:

- Sharing
- Building
- Helping
- Growing
- Solving

`	`*How does a good partnership feel?*

`	`Prompt students to think about how a good partnership feels, asking guiding questions like:

- What are some words or short four word phrases that describe how it feels to be in a partnership, or the result of a partnership?
- What does a productive partnership feel like?

`	`Ask students to share their ideas, and write them on the board/paper.

`	`Examples of words that might be shared:

- Working together for a goal
- Making a better world
- A Future that’s bright

`	`*What IS a good partnership?*

`	`Prompt students to think about one more word that can describe a good partnership.

`	`Ask students to share their ideas, and write them on the board/paper.

`	`Examples of words that might be shared:

- Unity
- Community
- Teamwork
- Alliance

`	`This word bank will give students a starting vocabulary to write their own poems.

**Collaborative Cinquain Creation**

`	`Now, the class will work together to create a cinquain poem, line by line, on the whiteboard/paper related to Global Goal 17. The goal is to show students how they can build a poem with everyone’s help.

`	`*Line 1:* Ask for a volunteer to give the first word of the poem.

- Example: Teamwork

`	`*Line 2:* Ask for a volunteer to give the two words for the second line. They should describe the first word.

- Example: Strong, together

`	`*Line 3:* Guide the entire class to write the three action words for the third line.

- Example: Solving a problem

`	`*Line 4:* Ask for a volunteer to give the four words for the fourth line, which will describe the feeling or the result.

- Example: Making the world better

`	`*Line 5:* Ask for a volunteer to give the final word, which summarizes the whole poem.

- Example: Hope

`	`Final Poem:

`		`Teamwork

`		`Strong, together

`		`Solving a problem

`		`Making the world better

`		`Hope

`	`After writing one or two cinquains together as a class, have students try to write their own cinquain poems (or write them within a pair) based on a theme from Global Goal 17. This gives them a chance to be creative while still working within the structure. Examples of themes:

- Sharing
- Technology
- Partnership
- Teamwork
- Unity
- Progress
- Support
- Trust
- Trade

**Small Group Sharing and Interpretation**

`	`When the writing is finished, divide the class into small groups (3-4 students). Each student will share their cinquain poem. This provides a safe, comfortable space to share their work and receive feedback.

`	`As the students are sharing in the groups, ask questions to help them have an open discussion about each other’s poems. These can be written on the board if helpful. Ask guiding questions like:

- What is the main idea of this poem?
- How does each line build on the one before it?
- How does the poem connect to the idea of a global partnership?
- What is one word that you thought was really powerful in this poem?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the simple structure of a cinquain poem help you write about a big, important idea like Global Goal 17?
- What did you learn about working together to create something?
- How did our class collaborative cinquain feel like a partnership?
- What is one thing you can do to be a better partner in your own life, whether it’s at school, with your family, or with your friends?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, collaborative writing and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., teamwork, sharing, technology) as demonstrated through the word choices and the overall meaning of the cinquain poems.
- Originality and effectiveness in contributing to cinquains that adhere to the established word-count structure (1-2-3-4-1), while still conveying meaningful content.
- How clearly and powerfully the cinquain poems communicate their intended message. Did the concise form successfully evoke thought or emotion related to global partnerships?
- Ability to work effectively within small groups, listening to each other’s poems and providing thoughtful feedback.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member within the small groups, evidenced by attentive listening and he ability to articulate what was observed and learned from classmates’ artwork. 
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of creative writing and collective creation in advocating for global cooperation and the complexities of building effective partnerships.

**Introduction**

Begin with an introduction or reintroduction and explanation of UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and half and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of these ecosystems for all life on Earth.

Provide a holistic overview of the goal, highlighting key themes:

- The beauty and diversity of terrestrial ecosystems.
- The interconnectedness of all living things.
- The threats to these ecosystems (deforestation, habitat loss, etc.).
- The urgency of conservation and sustainable practices.

Introduce “Follow the Leader” by explaining the basic concept:

- One person leads, the everyone else copies their movements.

Explain that the class will utilize this format to explore different aspects of Life on Land.

Emphasize that the focus is on:

- Simple, clear movements.
- Expressing ideas and emotions through movement.
- Working together as a group.

Start with a few simple examples

- Everyone, follow me as I show the movement of wind through the trees.
- Now, follow me as I show the growth of a plant.
- Let’s all follow as I show the movement of a deer through the forest.

**Guided Movement Exploration: Ecosystems and Threats**

Lead the class through a series of “Follow the Leader” sequences, each focusing on a specific aspect of Global Goal 15.

Emphaisze clear instructions, varied movement qualities, and inclusive language.

Examples of movement sequences:

- *Forest Ecosystem (Targets 15.1 and 15.2)*
  - I’ll be the wind, you follow my movements as I sway the trees, rustle the leaves, and move through the forest. (Focus: flowing, gentle movements, variations in speed and intensity.)
  - I’ll be a seed, you follow my movements as I sprout, grow, and reach for the sunlight (Focus: slow, upward movements, expanding gestures)
- *Grassland Ecosystem (Targets 15.1 and 15.5)*
  - I’ll be the tall grass, you follow my movements as I sway in the breeze, bend in the wind, and ripple across the landscape. (Focus: fluid, wave-like movements, use of levels (high and low).)
  - I’ll be a grazing animal, you follow my movements as I move across the grassland, searching for food. (Focus: Grounded, purposeful movements, exploring different speeds and directions)
- *Deforestation (Targets 15.2 and 15.9)*
  - I’ll be the forest, full of life. You follow my movements as I show the trees standing tall and strong. (Focus: Strong, upright movements, expansive gestures.)
  - I’ll be the chainsaw, you follow my movements as I cut down the trees, showing the destruction. (Focus: sharp, forceful movements, restricted gestures.)
- *Desertification (Target 15.3)*
  - I’ll be the wind and the sun, drying out the land. You follow my movements as I show the parched earth, the cracked soil, and the scarcity of life. (Focus: dry, brittle movements, limited range of motion)
  - I’ll be the rain, bringing life back to the land. Follow my movements as I show the softening of the soil, the growth of new plants. (Focus: Flowing, restorative movements, gentle and gradual.)
- *Endangered Species (Targets 15.5 and 15.7)*
  - I’ll be an endangered animal. Follow my movements as I show its beauty, its fragility, and its struggle to live. (Focus: Expressive movements, conveying vulnerability and strength.)
  - I’ll be the threat of poaching. Follow my movements as I show the pursuit, the capture, and the loss. (Focus: sharp, aggressive movements, creating tension and urgency.
- *Invasive Species (Target 15.8)*
  - I’ll be the native plant life. Follow my movements as I show the thriving ecosystem. (Focus: harmonious, balanced movements, showing interconnectedness.)
  - I’ll be the invasive species, you follow my movements as I show its aggressive spread and disruption. (Focus: forceful, disruptive movements, taking over the space.)

Throughout the exercises:

- Provide clear and concise instructions.
- Demonstrate the movements with energy and clarity.
- Encourage students to explore and interpret the imagery in their own way.
- Emphasize safety and inclusivity.

**Creative Follow the Leader**

After the guided sequences, facilitate a period of creative “Follow the Leader.”

Invite students to take turns being the leader (by having them volunteer or choosing them), creating their own movements inspired by Global Goal 15.

Encourage students to:

- Focus on a specific aspect of Global Goal 15.
- Use a variety of movement qualities (e.g., flowing, sharp, sustained).
- Explore different levels (high, medium, low) and directions.
- Consider the emotional impact of their movements.

Participate and offer suggestions as needed. Examples of starter prompts:

- Let’s explore the movement of a plant growing, how would you show that?
- Can you lead us in a sequence that represents the feeling of being in a forest?
- Show us how an animal moves through its habitat.
- Let’s see your interpretation of the wind blowing across a grassland.
- How would you move to represent the power and energy of a wildfire?
- Lead us in a movement that shows the diversity of life in a rainforest.
- Can you show us the unique way an endangered animal moves?
- Lead us in a sequence that represents the interconnectedness of species in an ecosystem.
- Show us the movement of a tree being cut down.
- Can you express, through movement, the feeling of loss when a forest is destroyed?
- Lead us in a sequence that represents the process of reforestation.
- Show us the movement of dry, cracked earth.
- Can you represent the struggle to survive in a desert environment?
- Lead us in a sequence that shows the process of land degradation.
- Show us how human actions can harm a forest.
- Can you represent the balance between human needs and environmental protection?
- Lead us in a sequence that shows humans working to restore a damaged ecosystem.
- Show us the urgency of the need to protect endangered species.
- Can you represent the speed at which deforestation is happening?
- Lead us in a sequence that expresses the need for immediate action.
- Show us the resilience of nature’s ability to heal.
- Can you represent the feeling of hope for a sustainable future?
- Lead us in a sequence that celebrates the beauty of life on land.

**Cool-down and Discussion**

Lead a gentle cool-down to bring the energy back down and prepare for reflection.

Include stretching, deep breathing, and calming movements.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What was your experience with the Follow the Leader exploration?
- Which movements or themes were most powerful for you?
- What did you learn about your own capacity for expression and creativity?
- How can dance and movement be a tool for raising awareness and inspiring action?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using the “Follow the Leader” format help you physically connect with the themes of life on land and the challenges facing terrestrial ecosystems?
- What did you learn about how different movement qualities (like flowing, sharp, strong, fragile) can represent various aspects of the environment, such as forest growth, desertification, or animal movement?
- Did embodying concepts like deforestation or the resilience of nature through movement spark any new emotions or insights for you?
- What did you discover about your own capacity for expression and adaptability through following and leading different movement sequences?
- How can connecting with these environmental issues through movement make them feel more immediate or personal?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 15 and the importance of protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems through this movement exploration?
- How did the various “Follow the Leader” sequences (e.g., forest ecosystem, deforestation, endangered species) illuminate the diverse challenges and opportunities within Global Goal 15?
- Did the activity make you think differently about the interconnectedness of all living things on land and how human actions impact them?
- How does a holistic understanding of life on land, as explored through movement, relate to the broader goals of a sustainable future?
- Did any particular movement sequence or the experience of leading/following resonate with you on a personal level, perhaps sparking a new commitment to environmental protection?
- What emotions did you connect with during this dance activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action for life on land?
- What is one key takeaway about terrestrial ecosystems and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- What is one specific action, big or small, that you feel inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to achieving Global Goal 15?

**Assessment**

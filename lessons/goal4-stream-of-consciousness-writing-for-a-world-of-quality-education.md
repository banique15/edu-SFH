Pens/pencils  
Whiteboard or large chart paper  
Markers  
\[Optional\] Index cards or sticky notes for anonymous sharing

**Introduction**  
Begin by introducing the concept of "stream of consciousness" writing in a way that resonates with the class.  
Example of how to explain: 

* Brains are like a bustling river, and sometimes, ideas, feelings, and memories just flow through it, one after another, without a neat, organized plan. That's what stream of consciousness is; writing down everything that comes into your mind, almost like you're having a conversation with yourself on paper without worrying about perfect sentences, spelling, or even staying on topic sometimes\!

Start with a question that connects to their everyday experience:

* Have you ever been sitting in class, and suddenly, your mind just wanders? Maybe you start thinking about what you want for lunch, or the video game you played last night, or something fun that happened over the weekend, even while we are supposed to be learning? (Emphasize this is normal and happens to everyone\!)

Define "stream of consciousness":

* "Stream of consciousness" writing is a special way to capture all of those thoughts as they flow, without stopping or judging them. It's like opening up a faucet in your brain and letting all the words just pour onto the page. No erasing, no going back, just writing what comes to mind. 

Connect to learning and Global Goal 4 by asking guiding questions like:

* How do you think writing down all of our thoughts, even the messy ones, might help us understand things better?  
* How might it help us think about big ideas, like making sure everyone gets a good education?

Hint that sometimes, our truest feelings about a topic may be hidden under layers of other thoughts.  
**Global Goal 4: Your Education, Your World**  
Introduce/reintroduce students to the idea of Global Goal 4\. Make it clear that this isn't just about abstract ideas; it's about their lives and the lives of other kids around the world.

* Today, we're going to use this writing style to explore something really important: Global Goal 4: Quality Education. This goal is all about making sure everyone on Earth \- every single boy and girl, no matter where they are or what their family is like \- gets a chance to learn and grow, not just for a little while, but for their whole lives.

Focus and call out one or two key targets that will resonate with your class, and discuss using guiding questions.  
Examples:

* *Target 4.1: Quality Education for All*  
  * This target says that by the year 2030, all boys and girls should finish primary and secondary school, and that the education they get should be very good and help them learn things that are actually useful. Think about your own classroom. What makes a lesson or class feel "good" or "quality"? Is it when you understand something new? When you feel excited to learn? When you can use what you learned in real life? What if som kids don't have enough books, or their teachers aren't able to teach them well? What if they have to work instead of going to school?  
    Examples of prompts and/or answers you may hear:  
    * Maybe you'd think: a good class is when the teacher makes science experiments feel like magic, and I actually understand how gravity works\!  
    * Quality means we have enough laptops for everyone, so we can all practice our coding skills and not just read about them.  
    * It's not quality if you have to sit on the floor because there aren't enough chairs, or if the lights don't work in your classroom.  
    * Maybe you'd imagine: it would be so sad if a kid had to stop going to school because their family needed them to earn money instead. They'd miss out on learning so much\!  
    * A useful lesson is when we learn how to manage our money, or how to fix something broken, not just memorize dates.  
* *Target 4.5: Fair Chance for Everyone*  
  * This target is super important. It says we need to make sure that everyone, no matter if they're a boy or girl, what culture they come from, or what situation they are in, gets the same fair chance to learn. Have you ever seen someone treated differently because of who they are? How does that feel? How important is it that school feels welcoming to everybody?  
    Examples of prompts and/or answers you may hear:  
    * Maybe you'd think: its not fiar if only the boys get to play soccer at recess, and the girls have to sit on the side.  
    * Everyone should feel comfortable speaking their own language sometimes, even if they're learning English. It makes them feel welcome.  
    * What if a new kid comes to school and no one talks to them because they look different or speak with an accent? That wouldn't be a fair chance to make friends or learn easily.  
    * Maybe you'd imagine: no one should be made fun of because of their clothes, or their family, or where they live. School should be a place where everyone feels important.  
    * A fair chance means if someone has trouble seeing, they get bigger print books, or if they need extra time on a test because of a learning difference, they get it.  
* *Target 4.a: Safe and Friendly Schools*  
  * This target talks about making sure schools are safe, kind places for everyone to learn. It means no bullying, no violence, and making sure the school building itself is good for everyone, including people who may use wheelchairs or have other needs. Think about your school. What makes it feel safe? What makes it feel welcoming? What would make it eve more welcoming for everybody?  
    Examples of prompts and/or answers you may hear:  
    * Maybe you'd think: my school feels safe because the teachers are always in the hallways, and I know who to go to if I have a problem.  
    * It's welcoming when the older kids help the younger ones, and everyone cleans up the cafeteria so it's a nice place to eat.  
    * What if someone in a wheelchair couldn't get into the library because there were only stairs? That wouldn't be a good, welcoming school for them.  
    * A friendly school means no one gets pushed in the halls, and if someone falls, other kids help them up instead of laughing.  
    * It would be more welcoming if our bathrooms were always clean and had soap, and if there was a quiet space for kids who feel overwhelmed sometimes.

On the whiteboard, write down some of the class's initial thoughts or feelings connected to the chosen target(s). Encourage them to just blurt out words or short phrases \- reinforcing the "no filter" idea (within reason).  
**The Stream of Consciousness Journey**  
This is the core writing activity. Emphasize that there are no wrong answers and no need to be perfect.  
Set the stage and let students know it is time to let their thoughts flow. Have them find a comfortable spot, and if they want, encourage them to close their eyes for a moment and just think about what has been discussed. Ask guiding questions like:

* What does "quality education" mean to you?  
* What would a fair school look like?  
* What does a safe school feel like?

Give students a moment to let those ideas swirl around in their heads.  
Prompt students to write continuously for \[choose a time, 8-12 minutes is recommended\]. Their goal is to keep their pen moving the entire time without stopping.   
Let students know that even if they feel they are stuck, it is better to write "I'm stuck I'm stuck" until another thought comes. If they think about their lunch, write it down, remember something from yesterday, write it down.  
Let their thoughts about education, their experiences, hopes, worries, dreams for themselves and others, pour onto the page. They can write about what they like about school, what they wish was different, what they imagine schools are like in other places, or anything that pops into their head related to learning and fairness in education.  
Give students suggestions of internal flows if needed:

* My teacher today was talking about…and then I thought about…and sometimes I wonder if kids in other places get to learn about…and I wish everyone could have…  
* When I think about a fair school, I think about…and I hope everyone, no matter if they're different from me, feels…because once I saw someone who was left out and it made me feel…  
* School feels safe when…but sometimes I worry about…and I wish our playground had…because everyone should feel really good and happy coming to school…

Have students begin writing. Challenge them to try to not lift their pen.  
Walk around quietly, offering gentle encouragement if you see someone stuck. Remind gently if they stop writing.  
After the time is up, announce to put all pens down. Congratulate students on completing steam of consciousness writing\!  
**Sharing the River's Treasures**  
*Note:* Creating a safe and encouraging space for sharing is crucial, especially with this age group and a personal writing style.

* *Emphasize choice:*   
  * What you wrote is very personal. You do not have tgo share anything you don't want to. But sometimes, when we share a little bit of our thoughts, we realize we're not alone, and we can learn from each other.  
* *Optional Anonymous Sharing:* For younger or more hesitant groups, offer index cards or sticky notes.   
  * If you'd like to share one thought or one short sentence from your writing, but you don't want to share out loud, you can write it on a sticky note and put it on the board. (You can then read a few aloud.)  
* *Voluntary Sharing:*  
  * If anyone feels comfortable, would you like to share just one sentence or a short phrase that jumped out at you from your writing? It doesn't have to be perfect; it's just a glimpse into your thoughts.

As students share (or as you read anonymous notes), help them see the connections to Global Goal 4\. Examples:

* I heard someone mention how important it is for teachers to be kind. Which part of Global Goal 4 does that connect to?  
* Someone wrote about wishing everyone had enough books. What target is that connected to?  
* I heard a thought about wishing everyone had enough books. What target is that connected to?  
* I heard a thought about how sad it would be if a kid couldn't go to school because they were a girl. Which target does that connect to?  
* Who else had a thought like that? Did anyone else write about wanting schools to be welcoming for all kids, no matter their physical limitations?  
* Did anyone write about a dream they have for their future education or what they want to learn?

On the whiteboard, as themes emerge, group them. For example:

* Importance of good teachers  
* Fairness for everyone  
* Safe places to learn  
* Having enough to learn with

Show students how their individual "streams" contribute to a bigger "river" of understanding about quality education.

**Reflection & Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did it feel to just write whatever came to your mind, without stopping or editing? Was it easy or hard? Did you discover anything surprising about your own thoughts or feelings about school or learning?  
* Did this kind of writing help you think about quality education in a new way, beyond just textbooks and homework?  
* Did exploring your own feelings about fairness or safety in school help you understand why Global Goal 4 is so important for everyone, everywhere?  
* How do you think our little actions (streams) can connect to a huge goal like Global Goal 4, which is about changing the world?  
* How does understanding your own experiences with education help you understand the experiences of kids in other parts of the world, and why it's so important that they get a quality education too?  
* What did you learn today about how personal feelings and thoughts can be important in understanding big global challenges?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial brainstorming, understanding stream of consciousness techniques, the individual writing process, and active participation in discussions (including sharing if applicable).  
* Comprehension of Global Goal 4 and its targets and core concepts (e.g., access, equity, quality, lifelong learning). This will be evidenced through the thematic content and emotional depth of the stream of consciousness writing and verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effectiveness in applying stream of consciousness writing, demonstrating an ability to let thoughts flow freely while still exploring the chosen topic and engaging with the concept of unfiltered expression.  
* How clearly and powerfully the finished writing piece communicates its intended message about education. Did the writing successfully evoke thought or emotion in the reader/listener?  
* Ability to explore personal connections, experiences, or imagined scenarios related to the education target, demonstrated empathy and a broadened perspective.  
* Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of unfiltered writing in self-discovery and understanding complex social issues.  
* New insights gained about self, education, or Global Goal 4, as articulated in reflections.

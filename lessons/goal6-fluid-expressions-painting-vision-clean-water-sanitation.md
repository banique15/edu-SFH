**Introduction**
**\
`	`Begin by showing images or videos of polluted water sources and contrasting them with pristine natural environments. Examples:

- Pristine Natural Environments
  - [Banff National Park, Canada](https://www.britannica.com/place/Banff-National-Park)
  - [Crater Lake National Park, Oregon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZADEu0QvmQ)
  - [Water of the Maldives](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/c7gnpz/does_anyone_else_find_crystal_clear_water_super/#lightbox)
  - [Great Barrier Reef, Australia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Barrier-Reef)
  - [Amazon Rainforest](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/where-does-amazon-river-begin/)
- Polluted Water Sources
  - [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/great-pacific-garbage-patch/)
  - [Bangladesh's "dead river"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=t85EDm75i1Q)
  - [Citarum River, Indonesia](http://www.austroindonesianartsprogram.org/blog/most-polluted-river-world-citarum-river-indonesia)
  - [Ganges River, India](https://www.borgenmagazine.com/israel-and-india-team-up-to-restore-the-ganges-river/)
  - [Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Gulf of Mexico](https://www.britannica.com/event/Deepwater-Horizon-oil-spill)

Open a discussion with questions like:

- How do these images make you feel?
- What role does water play in our lives and in the health of our planet?
- Beyond the immediate feeling, what long-term impact do you think these polluted scenes have? On people? On the environment?
- Contrastingly, what opportunities or benefits do you see in the pristine images and videos? How might access to clean water change lives?
- Do you think art can be a tool to make people care about environmental issues? Why or why not?
- Can you think of any examples where art has been used to raise awareness about pollution or water scarcity?

`	`Briefly re-introduce Global Goal 6 if needed: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."

`	`Explain how color field painting, with its emphasis on large areas of flat color and emotional impact, can be a powerful way to represent the vastness and importance of water, as well as the challenges and solutions related to its preservation.

`	`Share images of color field paintings and artists. Examples:

- [No. 61 (Rust and Blue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._61_\(Rust_and_Blue\)), Mark Rothko: This painting features contrasting colors that evoke a sense of depth and mystery, inviting viewers to explore their own interpretations.
- [Mountains and Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_and_Sea), Helen Frakenthaler: This groundbreaking work, created using her signature "soak-stain" technique, features flowing colors that evoke a sense of fluidity and movement, reminiscent of water.
- [Riverhead](https://www.frankenthalerfoundation.org/artworks/riverhead/details/all), Helen Frankenthaler: The flowing, watery forms and colors in "Riverhead" can symbolize the essential nature of water, its dynamic movement, and the interconnectedness of water systems.
- [PH-950](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/clyfford-still-ph-950), Clyfford Still: The contrasting colors and textures in this abstract piece can be interpreted as representing the stark difference between polluted and clean environments. The jagged edges and dark hues may evoke feelings of unease or alarm, highlighting the negative impacts of pollution on our water sources and the urgency of addressing this issue.
- [Light Depth](https://www.si.edu/object/light-depth%3Ahmsg_2018.036), Sam Gilliam: This large-scale, draped canvas installation, with its vibrant colors and flowing forms, can evoke a sense of the vastness and power of water. It can also represent the importance of access to clean water for all, as well as the need for sustainable water management practices to preserve this precious resource.

`	`Discuss how colors and their interplay can evoke emotions and convey ideas without relying on representational forms.

**Color and Target Connection**
**\
`	`Divide the class into small groups or allow them to work individually. 

`	`Assign each a different Global Goal 6 Target, providing them with the simplified explanations to ensure understanding.

`	`Each group/student brainstorms colors that represent the emotions, challenges, and solutions associated with their assigned target.

`	`Encourage students to think beyond literal representations and consider the symbolic and emotional power of colors.

`	`Use guided questions during brainstorming to help students find their way. Examples:

- What colors represent the emotions associated with the goal/target? (e.g., hope, fear, anger, joy, etc.)
- What colors symbolize the challenges and solutions related to this goal/target? (e.g., polluted water vs. clean water, scarcity vs. abundance, etc.)
- Are there any cultural or symbolic associations with specific colors that are relevant to this goal/target?
- How can we use color combinations and contrasts to create a powerful visual message?

`	`Example color palettes for Global Goal 6 targets

**Expressive Painting: A Watery World**

`	`Students create their paintings, whether they are individual or collaborations.

`	`Encourage experimentation with layering, blending, and contrasting colors to create depth and visual impact.

`	`Explore different brushstrokes and techniques to create textures and movement that represent the flow and dynamism of water.

`	`Allow students to incorporate symbolic elements or imagery that connect to their assigned goal/target. (e.g., water droplets, waves, polluted landscapes, hands washing with soap, etc.)

**Artist Showcase and Deciphering the Message**
**\
`	`Decide on an order for presentations, allowing each student or group to showcase their artwork.

`	`The presenting group/student reveals ONLY their assigned Global Goal 6 target, not any explanation of their art yet.

`	`The rest of the class observes the painting for a minute or two in silence.

`	`Open the floor for interpretations, using questions such as:

- What emotions do you see in this piece?
- What symbols or techniques stand out, and what might they represent?
- Based on the colors and compositions, what do you think this artwork is saying about the goal/target?

`	`The artist(s) now share their thought process, answering questions such as:

- Why did they choose those specific colors, shapes, etc.?
- What personal connections or experiences influenced their work?
- What message do they hope viewers take away from it?

`	`If time allows and is wanted, allow for a few questions from the class to the artist(s) for clarification or deeper understanding.

`	`Have a guided discussion, after all presentations are completed. Use guided questions such as:

- Were there any surprises in how your classmates interpreted your work?
- Did hearing the artist's explanation change how you saw the piece?
- Which artworks resonated with you the most, and why?
- Did the art help you see the Global Goal 6 targets in a new light?
- How did the use of color and abstraction convey the complexity of these issues?
- Do you think art can be a more impactful way to communicate about these topics than just facts and figures? Why/why not?
- Did any artwork make you reflect on your own water usage or habits?
- How can we, as individuals, contribute to solutions for clean water and sanitation?
- Do you feel more connected to this global goal now, having explored it through art?

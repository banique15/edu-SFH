## Building Justice: Devised Theater For a Peaceful World

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Open space suitable for movement and group work

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

Pens/Pencils

[Optional] Simple, easily manipulated props that can be used symbolically (e.g., fabric scraps, ropes, blocks, signs with keywords like “power,” “truth,” “voice”)

**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to devised theater.

- Devised theater is a way of creating theater collaboratively, without a pre-written script. Instead, the group uses ideas, themes, images, sound/voice, and movement to build a performance together.
- Think of it as collective storytelling through action, sound, and words. Everyone’s ideas contribute to the final piece.
- Today, we will use simple techniques to explore important ideas about peace and justice.

Introduce basic elements of devised theater:

- *Stimulus:* A starting point for creation (e.g., a word, an image, a feeling, a current event related to Global Goal 16).
- *Improvisation:* Spontaneous acting, vocalization, and movement to explore ideas.
- *Physical theater:* Using the body to communicate meaning.
- *Sound and Rhythm:* Incorporating vocal sounds, improvised words/phrases, body percussion, or simple rhythms.
- *Space and Levels:* Using the performance area in different ways (high, low, near, far).

Emphasize that the focus will be on simple explorations and collective creation, not a polished and “perfect” performance.

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Emphasize the relevance of these principles to their lives and the world around them.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:

- Reducing violence and promoting safety.
- Ending abuse and exploitation.
- Combating corruption and organized crime.
- Building effective and inclusive institutions.
- Promoting participation and access to information.

Connect devised theater and Global Goal 16 by engaging students in a discussion about how devised theater can explore themes of peace and justice.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use movement and gesture to represent concepts like fairness or unfairness?
- Can we create a short piece that shows the impact of violence or the building of peace?
- How can we use improvised vocalizations, sound, and rhythm to express the urgency of justice or the strength of institutions?
- How can working together to create theater mirror the idea of building inclusive societies?

**Collaborative Devised theater Exploration**

Begin a whole class brainstorm (stimulus) by presenting a series of simple stimuli related to different targets of Global Goal 16. For each stimulus, have students briefly brainstorm associated images, feelings, or actions.

Examples of stimuli (can use as prompts or have the class come up with their own):

- **Target 16.1** *(Reduce Violence):* 
  - The word “silence” after a loud noise. 
  - The feeling of a tightly clenched fist slowly opening.
- **Target 16.2** *(End Abuse):* 
  - The image of someone being trapped or restricted.
  - A broken bird’s wing.
- **Target 16.3** *(Rule of Law):* 
  - The idea of a balanced scale.
  - The sound of a gavel striking.
- **Target 16.4** *(Illicit Flows):* 
  - The action of something hidden being revealed.
  - A dark, winding river.
- **Target 16.5** *(Reduce Corruption):* 
  - The feeling of something being “sticky” or difficult to move.
  - The image of a spiderweb trapping something.
- **Target 16.6** *(Accountable Institutions):* 
  - The image of many hands working together to build something.
  - The feeling of a building with strong foundations.
- **Target 16.7** *(Inclusive Decision Making):* 
  - The action of many people contributing to a central point.
  - A circle of people all facing inwards.
- **Target 16.8** *(Global Governance):* 
  - The image of different shapes fitting together.
  - Different musical instruments playing together.
- **Target 16.9** *(Legal Identity):* 
  - The action of someone being recognized or seen clearly.
  - A single fingerprint.
- **Target 16.10** *(Access to Information):* 
  - The gesture of opening or revealing something.
  - A beam of light cutting through darkness.
- **Target 16.a** *(Strengthen Institutions):* 
  - The feeling of providing support or reinforcement.
  - The action of tying a knot to make something stronger
- **Target 16.b** *(Non-Discrimination):* 
  - The action of separating and then coming together equally.
  - Different colors blending together.

Begin guided improvisation and vocal/movement building by guiding the class through a series of simple, whole-class improvisations based on the brainstormed ideas for each stimulus, encouraging both vocal and movement improvisation.

For each target/idea, lead a short (2-3 minute) exploration:

Examples:

- **Target 16.1** *(Reduce Violence):* 
  - Let’s explore the feeling of a tightly clenched fist slowly opening. Everyone make a tight fist. Hold the tension in your body. Now, very slowly, release your fingers, your hand, your arm. What sounds might accompany this release? What words might express the shift from tension to calm?
- **Target 16.2** *(End Abuse):* 
  - Let’s explore the image of a broken bird’s wing. Find a posture that feels restricted or wounded. How might you move with this limitation? What sounds of pain, frustration, or longing might you make? What single word might capture this feeling?
- **Target 16.3** *(Rule of Law):* 
  - Let’s explore the sound of a gavel striking. Find a still, upright posture. Then, with  a sharp, clear movement and sound (clap, stomp, vocalization), represent the gavel. What feeling does this action evoke? What words might signify order, judgement, or fairness?
- **Target 16.4** *(Illicit Flows):* 
  - Let’s explore a dark, winding river. Move through the space as if you are this river, with hidden currents and unexpected turns. What sounds might the river make? What whispered words or phrases might represent secrets or hidden movements?
- **Target 16.5** *(Reduce Corruption):* 
  - Let’s explore the image of a spiderweb trapping something. Move as if you are caught, your movements sticky and difficult. What sounds of struggle or being ensnared might you make? What words might express being stuck or manipulated?
- **Target 16.6** *(Accountable Institutions):* 
  - Let’s explore the feeling of a building with strong foundations. Find a grounded, stable stance. Then, imagine adding layers or supports with your movements and sounds. What vocalizations represent strength, reliability, or shared effort? What simple word could be a foundation?
- **Target 16.7** *(Inclusive Decision Making):* 
  - Let’s explore a circle of people all facing inwards. Move as if you are offering a movement or sound to the center. Then, respond to what others offer. What sounds or phrases might represent your contribution or your response to others?
- **Target 16.8** *(Global Governance):* 
  - Let’s explore different musical instruments playing together. Each person choose a simple sound or movement rhythm. Then, try to layer these together, listening and responding to create a collective harmony or dissonance. What words or sounds might represent agreement or disagreement?
- **Target 16.9** *(Legal Identity):* 
  - Let’s explore the action of someone being recognized or seen clearly. Start with a closed-off posture. Then, slowly unfold and reveal a unique gesture or movement. What sound or word(s) might represent being seen, identified, or having a voice?
- **Target 16.10** *(Access to Information):* 
  - Let’s explore a beam of light cutting through darkness. Start in a shadowed or closed-off position. Then, with a focused movement and sound, break through into an open, illuminated space. What sounds or words might represent the revealing of truth or access to knowledge?
- **Target 16.a** *(Strengthen Institutions):* 
  - Let’s explore the action of tying a knot to make something stronger. Use your body to show something weak or unstable. Then, with focused movements, show the act of reinforcing or connecting. What sounds or short phrases might represent building strength or providing support?
- **Target 16.b** *(Non-Discrimination):* 
  - Let’s explore the action of separating and then coming together equally. Start with distinct, separate movements or sounds. The, gradually blend them, finding moments of harmony or shared rhythm. What sounds or words might represent separation, then unity and equality?

Encourage students to:

- Focus on vocal and physical communication.
- Explore different levels, speeds, and energy levels in both voice and movement.
- Respond to the vocalizations and movements of others in the group.
- Keep the focus on the core concept related to the idea surrounding Global Goal 16.

Basical theatrical elements can be introduced to enhance the improvisation:

- *Levels:* Using different heights to create interest and symbolize power or vulnerability both in movement and vocal pitch.
- *Pacing:* Varying the speed of speech and movement.
- *Focus:* Directing attention with the voice and body.
- *Repetition:* Repeating sounds, improvised words, or movements for emphasis.
- *Vocal Tone:* Using different tones of voice to convey emotion (e.g., anger, fear, hope).

**Connection and Discussion**

Facilitate a class discussion connecting the devised theater work to Global Goal 16.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did we use our voices and movement to represent the ideas of peace and justice?
- Which movements or vocalizations were most effective in conveying a specific target of Global Goal 16?
- What did you notice about how the group worked together to create meaning through both action and sound?
- How can this way of creating theater help us understand complex social issues and give voice to different perspecives?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

## A Limerick Lesson on Justice

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Audio (for playing limericks, if wanted)

**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to limericks.

A limerick is a humorous, five-line poem with a specific rhyming scheme (AABBA) and syllable structure. 

The first, second, and fifth lines are longer and rhyme, and the third and fourth lines are shorter and rhyme.

Limericks often tell a short, funny story or make a witty observation. NOTE: Many “traditional” limericks may be inappropriate for students. Straddle the line of communicating the fun and comedy of limericks without being inappropriate for the class.


Share examples of limericks:

- *Oh Teenage Metabolism, Where Art Thou* by John Watt

`	`When I was a teen, I would munch *(A rhyme)*

`	`My way through the whole Sunday brunch. *(A rhyme)*

`	`I’d destroy the buffet, *(B rhyme)*

`	`Then as we walked away, *(B rhyme)*

`	`I would ask my poor mother, “When’s lunch?” *(A rhyme)*

- *The Skateboarder* by Drjim Martin

A skateboard he tried to ride.

He didn’t there long abide.

It went airborne,

It did not forewarn,

He landed on his under side!

- *Job Interview* by Nitesh Aggarwal

There once was a boy, named Abdul;

Went to get a job, fresh out of school

All dressed up like July,

With a bow and a tie;

But left his fly open, what a fool!

- *Girl In My Class* by Nitesh Aggarwal

  There once was a girl in my class.

  One day I tried to make a pass.

  My cheek still sting,

  My ears still ring,

  Yet married to me; Alas!

Explain the AABBA rhyme scheme and the general rhythm/syllable count (though strict counting isn’t crucial for this activity). 

- The first line rhymes with the second line. (A)
- The third line rhymes with the fourth line. (B)
- The fifth line rhymes with the first and second line. (A)
- AABBA
- Lines 1, 2, and 5 (the longer ones) have a similar, bouncy rhythm with more emphasis at the beginning and end. **There** ONCE was a FELLOW so **BOLD**.
- Lines 3 and 4 (the shorter ones) have a quicker, lighter rhythm. **He** RAN down the **STREET**.
- While there is a specific syllable count that’s often taught (around 8-9 syllables for the long lines and 5-6 for the short), for this activity, focus on the general feel of the rhythm. It is more about the musicality than counting every single syllable perfectly.

Emphasize the humorous and often slightly absurd nature of limericks.

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Emphasize that while limericks are often funny, they can also be used to make serious points in an engaging and memorable way.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:

- Reducing violence and promoting safety.
- Ending abuse and exploitation.
- Ensuring justice and the rule of law.
- Combating corruption and organized crime.
- Building effective and inclusive institutions.
- Promoting participation and access to information.

Connect limericks and Global Goal 16 by engaging students in a discussion about how the limerick form can be used to explore themes of peace, justice, and strong institutions. 

Write a simple example on the board and label the rhyming lines. 

Examples:

- There once was a judge named Sue Bright, *(A)*

  Whole rulings were truly quite a strange sight. *(A)*

  She’d yell with a plea, *(B)*

  “Just let me be free!”, *(B)*

  And chaos ensued through the night. *(A)*

- There once was a mayor so greedy, *(A)*

  Whose hands were quite terribly needy. *(A)*

  For a bridge made of cheese, *(B)*

  He’d just whisper “Oh Please!”, *(B)*

  Then his pockets would jig quite freely. *(A)*

- There once was a student so keen, *(A)*

  On justice, a powerful scene. *(A)*

  They spoke up so bold, *(B)*

  A story untold, *(B)*

  For fairness, their spirit was clean. *(A)*

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can the humor in limericks make serious topics more accessible and relatable?
- Can we use the short, punchy format to make a memorable point about justice or fairness?
- How can we use the rhyming scheme to emphasize key words or ideas related to Global Goal 16?
- Can the often-absurd scenarios in limericks highlight the absurdity of injustice or corruption?

**Collaborative Limerick Creation: Justice in Rhyme**

Introduce a specific target/idea or a general theme related to Global Goal 16.

Students take a few minutes to individually brainstorm ideas, characters, scenarios, or keywords related to that theme that could fit into a limerick. Give prompts if needed and/or helpful.

*Examples of prompts:*

- **Target 16.1** *(Reduce Violence):* Think of a silly situation where someone tries to start a fight but hilariously fails due to clumsiness or misunderstanding.
- **Target 16.2** *(End Abuse of Children):* Brainstorm a cartoonish scenario where children cleverly outsmart someone trying to exploit them.
- **Target 16.3** *(Rule of Law):* Consider a funny instance where someone tries to get away with breaking a very obvious or silly law.
- **Target 16.4** *(Reduce Illicit Flows):* Imagine a ridiculous attempt to smuggle something absurd across borders.
- **Target 16.5** *(Reduce Corruption):* Think of a public official whose bribery attempts are so clumsy and obvious they become a joke.
- **Target 16.6** *(Accountable Institutions):* Imagine a government department that tries to be too transparent, leading to comical chaos.
- **Target 16.7** *(Inclusive Decision-Making):* Brainstorm a funny scenario where a very unusual or unqualified individual gets a say in a big decision.
- **Target 16.8** *(Global Governance):* Consider a humorous misunderstanding or cultural clash at a meeting of world leaders.
- **Target 16.9** *(Legal Identity for All):* Imagine a mix-up involving someone with a very strange or nonexistent name.
- **Target 16.10** *(Public Access to Information):* Think of a funny attempt to uncover a silly or completely obvious “secret.”
- **Target 16.a** *(Strengthen National Institutions):* Imagine a group of very inept individuals trying to learn how to prevent violence.
- **Target 16.b** *(Non-Discriminatory Laws):* Brainstorm a humorous situation where someone’s silly prejudice leads to an absurd and ironic outcome.

Lead the class in writing limericks together on the whiteboard or chart paper, line by line.

Line 1 (Introduce a character and/or setting)

- Call on students to share their brainstorming ideas for the first line, ensuring a variety of suggestions are offered. The class collectively chooses one that is promising and fits the A rhyme.

`	`Example:

- Let’s write a limerick about reducing violence. Who has an idea for the first line, introducing a character or situation?
- There once was a town full of strife.

Line 2 (Describe the character/setting or expand the first line)

- Ask for suggestions for the second line that rhymes with the first and continues the idea.

`	`Example:

- We need a second line that rhymes with “strife” and tells us more.
- Whose people all carried a knife.

Lines 3 and 4 (Shorter lines, different rhyme)

- Guide the class to brainstorm the shorter third and fourth lines that rhyme with each other and introduce a twist or further develop the scenario.

  Example:

- Now for the shorter lines, rhyming. What happened with all the knives?
- Then one silly day.
- They put them all away.

Line 5 (Punchline, rhymes with lines 1 and 2)

- Ask for a final, longer line that rhymes with the first two and provides a humorous or insightful conclusion related to the theme.

  Example:

- Now, a longer line rhyming with “strife” and “knife” that wraps it up.
- And the town became peaceful for life.

Ensure everyone is contributing by calling on different students for each line, encouraging participation from those who might be less vocal.

Offer suggestions and guide rhyme and rhythm as needed.

The class can write multiple limericks together, each focusing on a different target or aspect of Global Goal 16.

Examples:

**Small Group Sharing and Discussion**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).

Each group chooses one or two of the collaboratively written limericks to discuss.

Ask guiding questions like:

- What was the main theme or target of Global Goal 16 addressed in this limerick?
- What humorous or witty elements did you notice?
- How effectively did the limerick convey a message about peace, justice, or strong institutions?
- What makes this limerick memorable or impactful?
- Could this limerick be used to raise awareness about Global Goal 16?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the humorous and concise format of the limerick help us approach and discuss often-serious topics related to peace, justice, and strong institutions?
- What did you learn about the power of rhyme and rhythm in making a message memorable or impactful, even if it’s funny?
- Did the collaborative process of writing limericks together, line by line, spark any unexpected insights or creative solutions?
- How can humor and wit, as used in limericks, make complex social issues more accessible or encourage people to think differently about them?
- What did you discover about your own creative potential when woring within a very specific poetic structure?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 16 and the challenges of achieving peaceful, just, and inclusive societies through our limerick creations?

- Did using a lighthearted approach to these topics help you see absurdities or contradictions in real-world injustices?
- What common themes or powerful (even in humorous) messages about fairness, accountability, or human rights emerged across our class’s limericks?
- How does a creative approach, like writing limericks, encourage engagement with global goals in a way that might differ from traditional learning?
- Did any of the limericks or the process of writing them spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with fairness, conflict, or authority?
- What emotions did you connect with during this activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 16?
- What is one key takeaway about peace, justice, and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?

## The Land’s Story: An Ecosystem Table Read for Life on Earth
**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Prepared Scripts [EXAMPLES](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbC81kQsOlIi3rwCrvy0SBEW17P-5TS?usp=sharing)

Chairs arranged around tables or in a semi-circle, creating a ‘reading space’

Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper
Pens/pencils

[Optional] A variety of sound-making objects (e.g., small shakers, a piece of wood for tapping, a spray bottle with water, etc.)

**Introduction**

	Begin by introducing the idea of a table read. Explain that actors use table reads to practice a script in the beginning stages of the play/movie/etc. Since they aren’t on a stage, they have to use their voices, tone, and facial expressions to bring the story to life. This is a great way to explore a big topic without needing a lot of rehearsal.

	Introduce the provided scripts. Explain that this/these script(s) is/are a special kind of play called Documentary Theater. It’s a play that uses real-world stories and ideas to talk about a real problem. The class will read a play or plays, each about a single ecosystem, such as a forest or a desert.

	Introduce Global Goal 15. Explain that this goal is about protecting the land, the forests, and all the animals and plants that live there. Our play(s) will focus on specific ecosystems that are in trouble, but the story is a way for us to understand a much bigger problem happening all over the world.

**Brainstorming Sounds and Feelings: The Ecosystem’s Voice**

	Tell students they will now participate in a brainstorming activity where they will use sounds to bring ecosystems to life, with the goal of thinking about how different parts of every ecosystem have their own “voice.”

	*The Healthy Ecosystem*

- Challenge students to use their voices (and sound-making objects if applicable) to create a soundscape. Ask students guiding questions (utilizing the objects to make sounds if desired) like:
  - What sounds do you hear in a healthy ecosystem?
  - What does a cricket in a field sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
  - What does a woodpecker in a forest sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
  - What does a gentle rain shower in a desert sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
- Write these words on the board, under “Healthy Ecosystem Sounds.” 

This can help students connect sounds to feelings like peace, quiet, and happiness.

	*The Threat*

- Have students imagine a threat entering the ecosystem and what it might sound like, asking students guiding questions (utilizing the objects to make sounds if desired) like:
  - What does a scared animal sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
  - What does a machine or a big, loud truck sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
- Write these words on the board, under “Threat Sounds.” 

This can help students connect sounds to feelings like fear, anger, and chaos.

	*The Hope*

- Challenge students to imagine what sounds they would hear if people were helping this ecosystem heal. Ask students guiding questions (utilizing the objects to make sounds if desired) like:
  - What does a new seed being planted sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
  - What does a community working together to help their land heal and grow sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
  - What does a group of animals re-building their home sound like?
    - Have students call out words that connect to or describe this sound.
- Write these words on the board, under “Hope Sounds.” 

This can help students connect sounds to feelings like hope, determination, and triumph.

**The Table Read**

	Have each student take just a few minutes to read the script to themselves. Tell them to look for the different characters and to think about how they would sound. Ask guiding questions like:

- What emotion is the character feeling?
- Is the character loud or quiet?
- Is the character fast or slow?

	Assign parts to students (or ask for volunteers). Not every student needs a role, but feel free to table read more than one script to give more role opportunities to students.

	Encourage students to use the brainstorming list to help find their characters voice.

	Have students perform the script out loud. Encourage students to use their voices to show emotion and to listen carefully to each other. Remind them that they can use a hand gesture or a change in facial expression to help show what the characters are thinking and feeling.

	If more than one script is being read, continue until all scripts have been performed/read.

**Post-Read Discussion**

	After the table read(s), lead a discussion about the experience. This is a chance for students to share their feelings and thoughts and to connect the play(s) to Global Goal 15.

- What was it like to act out a play without being on a stage?
- What was the most important message you heard in the play(s), as an audience member?
- What character’s words or feelings stood out to you the most?
- What did you learn about the importance of protecting the ecosystem from the play(s), either as an actor or an audience member?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did this table read make you think differently about problems like deforestation or desertification? Did hearing the different “voices” of the ecosystem make you feel more connected to it?
- The play showed us that everyone has a role to play. What is one small thing you can do to help a natural space in your community?
- What did you learn about the power of stories to help people understand a big problem and inspire them to help?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the sound brainstorm to the table read and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 themes (e.g., deforestation, biodiversity loss) as demonstrated through the vocal interpretation of the characters and the contributions to discussions.
- Ability to use vocal elements (tone, pitch, volume) to effectively portray the character and convey the emotion in the script.
- How clearly and powerfully the collective table read communicated its intended message. Did the students’ vocal performances successfully evoke thought or emotion?
- Ability to work together as an ensemble, demonstrating active listening and responsive reading.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening during other students’ readings and the ability to articulate what was observed and learned from the performance(s) during the post-read discussions.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life on land.

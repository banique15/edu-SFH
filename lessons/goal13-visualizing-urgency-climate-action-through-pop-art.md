**Introduction**

Begin with a dynamic introduction to Pop Art. Explain its origins in the 1950s and 1960s, its reaction to consumer culture, and its use of mass media imagery.

Pop Art emerged as a significant art movement in both the United Kingdom and the United States during the 50s and 60s. It was a reaction to several things:

- *Rebellion against Abstract Expressionism:* In the post-WWII era, Abstract Expressionism was a dominant force in the art world. Artists like Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning emphasized subjective expression and non-representational forms. Pop Art, in contrast, rejected this focus on individual emotion and embraced more accessible, representational imagery.
- *The rise of consumer culture:* The post-war period also witnessed a surge in consumerism. Mass production, advertising, and the availability of new consumer goods transformed everyday life. Pop Art directly engaged with this phenomenon, drawing inspiration from and often critiquing the culture of consumption.
- *Influence of mass media:* Pop Art artists were fascinated by the power and ubiquity of mass media. They incorporated imagery from:
  - *Advertising:* Product packaging, billboards, and commercials became sources of artistic inspiration.
  - *Comic Books:* Their bold graphics and narrative style were adopted and transformed.
  - *Television and Film:* Celebrities and iconic scenes from popular culture appeared in Pop Art.
  - *Photography:* Mass-produced photographs and news images were recontextualized as art.
- *Blurring the lines between high and low art:* Traditionally, there was a clear distinction between “high art” (fine art, classical art) and “low art” (popular culture, commercial art). Pop Art deliberately blurred these boundaries, elevating everyday objects and mass-produced imagery to the status of art.
- *Social commentary (often subversive):* While Pop Art celebrated some aspects of popular culture, it also often contained a critical edge. Artists used irony and satire to comment on:
  - *Consumerism’s superficiality:* Questioning the pursuit of material goods.
  - *The power of advertising:* Exposing its manipulative techniques.
  - *The cult of celebrity:* Examining the role of fame in society.

In essence, Pop Art reflected and challenged the changing social, cultural, and economic landscape of the mid-20th century. It was a bold and innovative movement that continues to influence art and visual culture today.

Highlight key characteristics:

- Bold colors and graphic style.
- Use of everyday objects and popular culture references.
- Repetition and serial imagery.
- Irony and satire.

Showcase examples of iconic Pop Art, focusing on:

- Different techniques (painting, printmaking, collage).
- The power of visual communication and social commentary.

`	`*Examples:*

- [Works of Andy Warhol](https://www.wikiart.org/en/andy-warhol) His iconic screen prints and photographs of celebrities and consumer goods (e.g., “Campbell’s Soup Cans,” “Marilyn Monroe”) showcase the repetition and mass production of consumer culture.
- [Works of Roy Lichtenstein](https://www.wikiart.org/en/roy-lichtenstein/all-works#!#filterName:all-paintings-chronologically,resultType:masonry) His comic-book inspired paintings with bold outlines and Ben-Day dots (e.g., “Whaam!,” “Drowning Girl”) demonstrate the use of graphic style and context.
- [Works of James Rosenquist](https://www.wikiart.org/en/james-rosenquist) His large-scale collages that juxtapose images from advertising and popular culture (e.g., “F-111”) explore themes of consumerism and technology.
- [Works of Claes Oldenburg](https://www.wikiart.org/en/claes-oldenburg) His sculptures of everyday objects (e.g., “Giant Hamburger,” “Soft Toilet”) transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, challenging our perceptions of reality.

Facilitate a brief discussion.

- What are your initial reactions to Pop Art?
- How does it differ from traditional art styles?
- How can Pop Art be used to address social and political issues?

Introduce and/or reintroduce UN Global Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Emphasize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action. Briefly review key targets and indicators if wanted.
Engage students in a though-provoking discussion about how Pop Art can be used to explore themes of climate change. Pose questions like:

- How can Pop Art’s bold visual style capture the urgency of the climate crisis?
- Can Pop Art’s use of mass media imagery help us critique consumerism and its impact on the environment?
- How can Pop Art’s techniques (repetition, bright colors) be used to visualize climate data or solutions?
- Can Pop Art’s ironic or satirical approach be used to challenge climate change denial or inaction?

**Exploring Pop Art Techniques and Brainstorming**

Demonstrate and discuss key Pop Art techniques that students can incorporate into their artwork:

- *Bold Colors and Graphic Style:* Use saturated colors, clear lines, and simplified shapes.
- *Repetition and Serial Imagery:* Repeat images or patterns to emphasize a message or create a visual rhythm.
- *Everday objects and popular culture references:* Incorporate images of consumer goods, technology, or celebrities.
- *Text and typography:* Use words and phrases in a bold and graphic way.
- *Collage and mixed media:* Combine different materials and images to create a layered effect.

Each student brainstorms ideas for a Pop Art piece that addresses a specific aspect of Global Goal 13. Encourage students to:

- Choose a specific climate change issue or solution to focus on.
- Use Pop Art techniques to create a visually striking and impactful message.
- Consider the emotional response they want to evoke in the viewer.
- Connect their artwork to their own experiences and observations.

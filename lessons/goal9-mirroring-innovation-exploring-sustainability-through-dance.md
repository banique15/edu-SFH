	Guiding Questions

* What are some of the challenges in achieving these targets?  
* How might these targets affect different people and communities around the world?

**Exploring Mirroring Techniques**  
*Basic Mirroring*

* Pair students up and have them practice basic mirroring exercises.  
* One student is the leader, and the other is the follower.  
* The leader initiates movements, and the follower mirrors them as closely as possible.

Encourage students to focus on clarity, precision, and nonverbal communication.

* Ensure both students have a chance to play both roles.

	Guiding Questions

* What are some of the challenges of mirroring?  
* How can you improve your mirroring skills?  
* How does it feel to be the leader versus the follower?

*Mirroring with Variations*  
	Introduce variations to the mirroring exercises, such as:

* Changing roles mid-mirror (without stopping the movement) (leder and follower switch).  
* Adding levels (high, medium, low).  
* Incorporating different qualities of movement (smooth, sharp, fluid, bound).  
* Adding emotional expression to the movement.

	Guiding Questions

* How do these variations affect the mirroring experience?  
* How can you use mirroring to express different ideas or emotions?

Discuss how mirroring can be used to create a sense of connection and empathy between partners.  
Encourage students to pay attention to their partner’s movements and energy, and to respond in a way that shows understanding and support.  
	Guiding Questions

* How does mirroring help you understand your partner better?  
* How can you use mirroring to build trust and support?

**Mirroring and Global Goal 9**  
Facilitate a brainstorming session where students generate ideas for how mirroring can be used to represent the different targets within Global Goal 9\.  
	Guiding Questions

* What are some movements qualities or dynamics that could represent each target?  
* How can we use mirroring to convey the challenges and opportunities associated with each target?  
* How can we use mirroring to express the interconnectedness of the different targets within Global Goal 9?

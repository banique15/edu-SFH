**Introduction**

Begin with a clear and engaging introduction or reintroduction of UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and half and reverse land degradation and half biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for life on Earth.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What are your favorite natural places on land?
- What are some of the biggest threats to these places?
- How can art help us appreciate and protect nature?

Explain the concept of natural art or land art.

- Natural art uses natural materials to create art in or about the natural world.
- It can be temporary or permanent, large-scale or small-scale.
- It often emphasizes the beauty and fragility of nature.

AND/OR

Students share the natural items they chose from the options available in the classroom, and speaking about why they were drawn to them.

- Encourage experimentation and creativity.
- Help students refine their compositions and messages.

Emphasize that the focus is on expressing ideas and emotions, not achieving perfect realism.

**Presentation and Discussion**

Students present their completed artworks to the class.

Facilitate a discussion during or after each presentation. Ask guiding questions like:

- What is the main message of the artwork?
- How did the artist use natural materials to convey their message?
- How does the artwork relate to Global Goal 15 and its targets?
- What impact do you think the artwork could have on its viewers?
- What did you learn about the importance of terrestrial ecosystems through creating this art?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did creating art using natural items (leaves, sticks, stones, etc.) help you connect with the themes of Life on Land in a different way than using traditional art supplies?
- What did you learn about the beauty fragility, and interconnectedness of terrestrial ecosystems by working directly with materials from nature?
- Did the act of collecting (if applicable) and arranging natural items change your perspective on their value or role in the environment?
- What did you discover about your own creativity when limited to using only natural materials?
- How can art made from natural elements help us to appreciate and respect the environment around us?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 15 and the importance of protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems through this art exploration?
- How did your artwork, and those created by your classmates, highlight the diverse challenges or hopeful solutions related to specific concepts of Global Goal 15 (e.g., deforestation, biodiversity loss, combating desertification)?
- Did creating art about life on land make you think differently about human impact on natural habitats?
- What common themes or powerful messages about natures resilience or the needs for conservation emerged across the different artworks you saw?
- How does a hands-on artistic exploration help to make a global goal like 15 more tangible and relatable?
- Did creating your natural artwork spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with nature or local ecosystems?
- What emotions did you connect with during this art activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 15?

***Introduction***  
	Ask students: "What does it mean to be truly healthy?"  
	Allow for a brief brainstorm, then introduce the idea that health is more than not being sick.  
	Discuss the importance of health and well-being

* *Personal Health* enables us to:  
  * Learn and grow  
  * Pursue our dreams  
  * Have fun and enjoy life  
  * Build strong relationships  
* *Community Health* contributes to:  
  * A strong workforce and economy  
  * Reduced poverty  
  * Safer communities  
  * A brighter future for everyone

	Open a discussion about how health is more than just physical fitness:

* *Mental Health* helps us:  
  * Feel good about ourselves  
  * Manage stress  
  * Get help when we need it  
* *Emotional Health* helps us:  
  * Recognize and express our emotions in healthy ways  
* *Social Well Being* helps us:  
  * Build strong relationships  
  * Feel connected to our community  
  * Support others

	Conclude by letting students know that they will be using art to explore what health and well being mean to them. The self-portraits they are going to create will reflect not jus thow they look, but how they feel \- physically, mentally, and emotionally.  
***Self Reflection and Brainstorming***  
	Have students sit comfortably with a mirror and observe their own reflections.  
	Ask them to consider the following questions:

* How do you define health and well-being for yourself?  
* What aspects of your health do you feel are strong and positive?  
* Are there any areas where you would like to improve your health or well-being?  
* How do the Global Goal 3 targets relate to your personal experiences and aspirations for health?

***Creating Self-Portraits***   
	Explain that students will create self-portraits that express their personal connection to health and well being.  
	Encourage them to think beyond realistic portraits and use symbolism, color, and mixed media to represent different aspects of their health.  
	Provide examples of self portraits by famous artists:

* Frida Kahlo: [Without Hope](https://www.fridakahlo.org/without-hope.jsp), [The Wounded Deer](https://www.fridakahlo.org/the-wounded-deer.jsp)  
* Vincent Van Gough: [Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Portrait_with_Bandaged_Ear),   
* Maria Lassnig: [Lady with Brain](https://cvonhassett.medium.com/maria-lassnigs-ways-of-being-87d9eedd35c9)  
* Salvador Dali: [Soft Self-Portrait with Fried Bacon](https://www.art-theoria.com/painting-of-the-month/soft-self-portrait-with-fried-bacon/)  
* Andy Warhol: [Digital Self-Portrait with Fright Wig](https://www.nga.gov/features/slideshows/andy-warhol-self-portrait.html)

	Offer suggestions for representing different aspects of health:

* *Physical Health:* vibrant colors, strong lines, active poses, images of healthy foods or exercise.  
* *Mental and Emotional Health:* calm colors, introspective expressions, symbols of peace or resilience, abstract representations of emotions.  
* *Social Well-being:* images of community, connection, and support, collaborative art elements.  
* *Challenges and Aspirations:* symbolic representations of struggles or goals related to health, using colors and textures to convey emotions.

**Gallery Walk and Discussion**  
	Create a gallery space where students can display their self-portraits.  
	Have students walk around and appreciate each other's work.  
	Facilitate a discussion about the artwork, encouraging students to:

* Share their creative choices and the meaning behind their self-portraits.  
* Identify common themes or symbols related to health and well being.  
* Discuss how the artwork reflects the different aspects of Global Goal 3\.  
* Talk about hwo they can support each other in their individual and collective journeys towards better health.

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did creating a self-portrait help you connect with your own health and well being?  
* How did creating a self-portrait focused on your health and wellbeing differ from creating a traditional self-portrait?  
* What aspects of your physical, mental, and emotional health did you chose to emphasize in your artwork, and why?  
* Did the process of self-reflection and brainstorming reveal any new insights about your own wellbeing and health?  
* In what ways did creating this self-portrait help you connect your personal experiences to the broader themes of Global Goal 3?  
* How did the discussion about the different dimensions of health (physical, mental, emotional, social) influence you artistic choices?  
* Did creating your self-portrait help you see the interconnectedness of these different aspects of your health? Can you give an example from your artwork?  
* How did exploring Global Goal 3 make you think differently about what it means to be truly healthy?  
* What rold do you think self-awareness and understanding play in our journey towards better health and wellbeing?  
* What personal goals for your own health and wellbeing did this self-reflection and art making process bring to light?  
* What are some ways that art, like your self-portrait, could be used to communicate the importance of health and wellbeing to others?

Guiding Questions

- What do you notice about these paintings?
- How do they make you feel?
- What do you think the artists were trying to express?

Facilitate a discussion about the key characteristics of Cubism

Key Points

- An early 20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture.
- Challenged traditional perspectives and representation, depicting subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously.
- Emphasized geometric forms, fragmentation, and the two-dimensionality of the canvas.
- Often incorporated collage elements and mixed media.

Guiding Questions

- How is Cubism different from traditional art styles?
- Why do you think the Cubists chose to fragment and distort their subjects?
- How does Cubism challenge our perception of reality?

Introduct/re-introduce Global Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. Explain the core idea of making citiesand human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

Briefly introduce the different targets within Global Goal 11, highlighting their interconnectedness and importance.

Guiding Questions

- What are some of the challenges facing cities today?
- How can we make cities more sustainable and livable for everyone?
- What role can art play in promoting sustainable development?

**Exploring Cubist Techniques**

*Fragmentation:* Discuss how Cubists fragmented objects and figures into geometric shapes and planes, showing them from multiple perspectives simultaneously.

In five minutes or less, have students quickly practice fragmenting simple objects (e.g., a cup, a chair, a building, etc.) into geometric shapes, drawing them from different angles and viewpoints.

Guiding Questions

- How does fragmentation change the way we see an object?
- How can fragmentation be used to represent the complexity of urban environments?

*Geometric Forms:* Discuss how Cubists used geometric shapes (cubes, cones, cylinders, spheres, etc.) to construct their compositions.

In five minutes or less, have students quickly practice drawing and arranging geometric shapes to create abstract or semi-abstrict compositions.

Guiding Questions

- How do geometric forms contribute to the visual impact of Cubist art?
- How can geometric forms be used to represent different aspects of a city or community?

*Multiple Viewpoints:* Discuss how Cubists challenged traditional perspective by showing objects and scenes from multiple viewpoints at once.

In five minutes or less, have students choose an object or scene and draw it from at least three different perspectives, combining these views into a single composition.

Guiding Questions

- How does seeing an object from multiple viewpoints change our understanding of it?
- How can multiple viewpoints be used to represent the diversity and complexity of urban life?

**Cubism and Global Goal 11**

Facilitate and brainstorming session where students generate ideas for Cubist-inspired artwork that connects to the different targets within Global Goal 11.

Guiding Questions

- What are some visual metaphors or symbols that could represent each target?
- How can we use Cubist techniques to convey the challenges and opportunities associated with each target?
- How can we use Cubism to inspire action and encourage people to contribute to achieving Global Goal 11?

Examples

- **Target 11.1** *(Affordable Housing):* Create a Cubist work of a diverse community with a variety of housing options, emphasizing inclusivity and accessibility.
- **Target 11.2** *(Sustainable Transportation):* Design a Cubist work depicting different modes of transportation, highlighting the interconnectedness of a city’s transportation network.
- **Target 11.3** *(Inclusive Urbanization):* Create a Cubist work of a city with overlapping perspectives and diverse communities, representing the complexity and dynamism of urban life.
- **Target 11.4** *(Cultural Heritage):* Develop a Cubist work incorporating images of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts, emphasizing the importance of preserving cultural heritage.
- **Target 11.5** *(Disaster Resilience):* Create a Cubist work depicting a city before, during, and after a natural disaster, highlighting the importance of resilient infrastructure and disaster preparedness.
- **Target 11.6** *(Environmental Impact):* Create a Cubist work with contrasting images of pollution and clean energy, representing the environmental challenges and opportunities facing cities.
- **Target 11.7** *(Green Spaces):* Develop a Cubist painting of a city with integrated green spaces, parks, and gardens, emphasizing the importance of nature in urban environments.
- **Target 11.a** *(Urban-Rural Links):* Create a Cubist work that combines images of urban and rural landscapes, emphasizing the interconnectedness of these environments and the importance of sustainable development that benefits both.
- **Target 11.b** *(Disaster Risk Reduction):* Create a Cubist painting that depicts a city’s response to a natural disaster, using fragmented perspectives and dynamic compositions to convey the chaos and resilience of the community.
- **Target 11.c** *(Sustainable Buildings in Least Developed Countries):* Create a Cubist work that depicts a sustainable building in a least developed county, using fragmented perspectives and geometric forms to showcase the integration of traditional building techniques with modern sustainable practices.

Each student selects one target from Global Goal 11 (or can focus on the Goal holistically) and creates a Cubist-inspired artwork that represents a specific aspect of that target/goal.

Encourage students to experiment with different Cubist techniques to convey their chosen message effectively.

While students work, circulate to observe, offer encouragement, and answer questions.

Guiding Questions

- How are you using fragmentation to represent this target?
- What message are you trying to convey with your use of geometric forms?
- How does your artwork encourage viewers to think about sustainable cities and communities?

**Exhibition and Discussion**

Once the artwork is complete, have students display their creations around the classroom. Allow time for students to walk around, view each other’s work, and engage in informal discussions.

Facilitate a class discussion about the artwork, focusing on the connection to Global Goal 11 and the effectiveness of the Cubist techniques.

Guiding Questions

- What are some of the most powerful or impactful artworks you saw?
- How did the different artworks make you think differently about Global Goal 11?
- What are some of the common themes or messages you noticed in the artwork?
- How did the use of Cubist techniques enhance the message of the artwork?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did exploring Cubism, with its focus on fragmentation and multiple perspectives, influence your approach to creating your artwork about sustainable cities?
- What artistic choices did you make in terms of color, shape, and composition to represent the complexities and challenges of urban environments?
- Did experimenting with Cubist techniques help you see the subject matter (sustainable cities) in a new or unexpected way?
- How did the process of creating a Cubist artwork allow you to express your ideas and feelings about Global Goal 11 beyond a purely representational style?
- What did you learn about the power of abstract art to communicate complex social and environmental issues?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 11 and the importance of sustainable cities and communities through this artistic expression?
- How did the different artworks created by your classmates broaden your understanding of the various dimensions of Global Goal 11?
- Did creating artwork focused on a specific idea surrounding Global Goal 11 help you connect with the challenges and opportunities on a deeper level?
- How did the use of Cubist techniques enhance of alter the message about sustainable cities compared to a more traditional artistic approach?
- Did creating your artwork spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with cities and sustainability in your community?
- What emotions did you connect with while creating your artwork, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 11?
- What are some of the key takeaways from the artworks and discussions today that you think are important for others to understand about sustainable cities?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Cubism, technique explorations, individual art creation, and class discussions.

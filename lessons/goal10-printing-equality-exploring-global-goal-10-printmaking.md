**Printmaking and Global Goal 10**  
Facilitate a brainstorming session where students generate ideas for printmaking projects that connect to the different targets within Global Goal 10\.  
	Guiding Questions

* What are some visual metaphors or symbols that could represent each target?  
* How can we use printmaking techniques to convey the challenges and consequences of inequality?  
* How can we use printmaking to promote understanding, empathy, and action towards achieving Global Goal 10?

	Examples

* **Target 10.1** *(Income Growth):* Create a print with a ladder motif, where the rungs represent different income levels, and the distance between the rungs symbolize income inequality.  
* **Target 10.2** *(Social Inclusion):* Create a print with overlapping figures and colors, representing the diversity and interconnectedness of society and the importance of inclusion.  
* **Target 10.3** *(Equal Opportunity):* Create a series of prints with figures breaking free from chains or barriers, symbolizing the struggle for equal opportunities and the dismantling of discriminatory systems.

* **Target 10.5** *(Financial Markets):* Create a print with abstract shapes and lines representing the complexity and interconnectedness of global financial markets, highlighting the need for regulation and transparency.  
* **Target 10.6** *(Global Institutions):* Create a print with a globe motif and figures representing different countries, emphasizing the importance of equitable representation and voice for developing countries in global decision-making.  
* **Target 10.7** *(Migration):* Create a series of prints depicting the journeys and experiences of migrants, highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with migration and the need for safe and responsible migration policies.

Divide students into smaller groups or allow them to work individually. Each group/student selects or is assigned one target from Global Goal 10 (or can focus on the Goal holistically) and creates a printmaking project that represents a specific aspect of that target/goal.  
Encourage students to experiment with different techniques to convey their chosen message effectively.  
While students work, circulate to observe, offer encouragement, and answer questions.  
	Prompt Deeper Thinking

* I see you’re using a lot of contrasting colors. How does that connect to the target you chose/Global Goal 10?  
* What message are you trying to convey with this image?  
* How does your artwork encourage viewers to think about inequality and social justice?

**Exhibition and Discussion**  
Once the artwork is complete, have students display their prints around the classroom. Allow time for students to walk around, view each other’s work, and engage in informal discussions.  
Facilitate a class discussion about the artwork, focusing on the connection to Global Goal 10 and the effectiveness of the chosen printmaking techniques.  
	Guiding Questions

* What are some of the most powerful or impactful artworks you saw?  
* How did the different artworks make you think differently about inequality and social justice?  
* What are some of the common themes or messages you noticed in the artwork?  
* How did the use of printmaking techniques enhance the message of the artwork?


  
**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did you use printmaking techniques (like relief, monotype, or stenciling) help you express your ideas and emotions about reducing inequalities?  
* What did you learn about how repetition and multiple copies (inherent in printmaking) can amplify a message about social justice or inequality?  
* Did the process of creating prints, even with simple materials, change how you perceive the visibility or permanence of issues related to inequality?  
* What did you discover about the power of graphic imagery and stark contrasts (often found in prints) to communicate urgent messages about social change?  
* How can printmaking, as an art form that can be easily reproduced and shared, be a powerful tool for broadcasting messages about equality and inclusion?  
* What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 10 and the complexities of reducing inequality within and among countries?  
* How did the artwork created by your classmates, using different approaches, broaden your understanding of diverse forms of inequality (e.g., income, social, access, migration)?  
* Did any specific print of the process of creating it make you think differently about the causes or consequences of inequality?  
* What common themes or calls to action for a more just and equitable world emerged across the different prints?  
* How does visual art, like printmaking, help to make abstract concepts of inequality more tangible and relatable?  
* Did creating your print spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences or observations related to fairness and equality in your life or community?  
* What emotions did you connect with while creating your artwork, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 10?

**Viewing**

Allow students about 5 minutes to engage with the chosen piece(s), giving the class more or less preamble/guidance about the artwork depending on their needs.

Provide a brief introduction to the artwork(s), including any background and/or context that might be important.

Adjust the level of guidance based on the students’ age and/or pror knowledge of art.

**Discussion**

- What emotions does this artwork evoke in you?
- What aspects of the ocean or marine life does the artwork highlight?
- What messages or stories do you think the artists are trying to convey about the ocean and our relationship with it?
- How do these artworks relate to the goals of Global Goal 14: Life Below Water?
- Can you identify any specific part of the artwork that resonates with a particular target of Global Goal 14? (e.g., pollution, overfishing, conservation) How so? 
- How does the artwork illustrate the beauty of the ocean?
- How does the artwork illustrate the challenges facing ocean ecosystems?
- What symbols or visual elements stand out to you and what might they represent in the context of ocean conservation?

Emphasize how art can be a powerful tool for expressing ideas, raising awareness, and inspiring action around ocean conservation.

**Personal Connection**

Ask students to reflect on their own experiences with the ocean (if any) and their connection to marine life. Ask questions like:

- What are some of your favorite ocean animals or marine environments?
- Have you ever visited the ocean or participated in activities related to the ocean (e.g., swimming, boating, visiting an aquarium)?
- What are some of the ways that humans rely on the ocean?
- Have you ever thought about the impact of your daily life on the ocean?
- Have you witnessed any examples of pollution or other threats to marine life?
- What are some ways that you, or your community can help protect the ocean?

Encourage students to share their personal stories and connect them to themes explored in the artwork.

**Closing Activity Options**

- **One Word Summary:** Ask each student to think of one work encapsulating their biggest takeaway or feeling about ocean conservation after this art exploration. Have them share their word with the class, briefly explaining their choice. Bonus: Collect all the words to make a word cloud.
- **Quote Connection:** Share an inspiring quote about ocean conservation. Facilitate an open discussion about how this quote connects tot he artwork and activity they experienced in class. *Example:* “We know that when we protect our oceans we’re protecting our future” -Bill Clinton   “No water, no life. No blue, no green.” -Sylvia Earle
- **Artwork Challenge:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to create a “flash ocean art” project using only recycled materials (especially plastics) in 10 minutes. Encourage them to consider the challenges facing the ocean and potential solutions.
- **Global Goal Gallery:** Have students work in groups to find other artwork that represents different aspects of Global Goal 14 and resonates with them.
- **Marine Creature Design:** Have students design their own imaginary marine creature that is adapted to survive in a polluted ocean. This encourages creative thinking about the challenges facing marine life.

**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an exciting drama/theater class. Explain that they will use their voices, bodies, and imaginations to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 9, Industry, Innovtion, and Infrastructure.  
Clarify that Global Goal 9 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to help communities and countries build strong, lasting things (like safe roads, schools, and hospitals) \- that’s infrastructure. Emphasize it’s also about new ideas and inventions that make life better \- that’s innovation. And it’s about making sure industries (where things are made) are fair and sustainable, helping everyone grow \- that’s industry. Basically, it’s about building a better, smarter world for everyone.  
Transition to the music activity. Begin by engaging students in a sound exploration activity, inviting them to listen deeply to the world around them and connect sounds to ideas.  
**Warm Up: Listen and Feel the World’s Sounds**  
Explain that they will listen to different sounds and think about what they are saying to them. Instruct students to close their eyes gently if comfortable.  
*Nature Sounds*

* Play a short audio clip of nature sounds.  
  Example  
  * [Forest Stream Sounds, Gentle Bird Song, Relaxing Nature Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wn-OSiNVjE)  
* Ask guiding questions like:  
  * What sounds did you hear?  
  * How did these sounds make you feel?  
  * What ideas or images came to mind?

*City/Machine Sounds*

* Play a short audio clip of city sounds or machine/factory sounds.  
  Examples  
  * [Night Walk in New York Times Square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6wyZyUq1k)  
  * [Sounds of a Factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjD2k9A-zRs)  
* Ask guiding questions like:  
  * What sounds did you hear?  
  * How did these sounds make you feel?  
  * What images or ideas came to mind?

*Musical Excerpt*

* Play a short musical excerpt that has a strong rhythm or clear melody (e.g., a march, a piece with clear layering, a piece that builds).  
  Example  
  * [Beethoven \- Symphony No. 5 (Proms 2012\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv2WJMVPQi8)  
* Ask guiding questions like:  
  * What sounds did you hear?  
  * How did the music make you feel?  
  * What images or ideas came to mind?

Facilitate a discussion about the connections between music, sound, and the themes of industry, innovation, and infrastructure. Ask guiding questions like:

* How can music be used to represent the sounds of building, machines, or new inventions?  
* How can music make us feel about progress, new ideas, or working together for a better world?  
* Can you think of any songs that make you feel like you can build something, or think of a new idea, or work as a team?

**Exploring Musical Concepts for Progress**  
Explain that music has special ingredients that help tell a story or show feelings, and they will try to find those about industry, innovation, and infrastructure. They will experiment with these concepts using instruments and voices.

* *Rhythm and Dynamics:* Rhythm is the pattern of sound (like a heartbeat or drumbeat), and dynamics refers to how loud or soft the music is.  
  * Ask: How would a fast, steady rhythm with loud dynamics show a busy factory or a quick, strong construction team?  
    * Encourage students to experiment with fast, loud rhythms on instruments, e.g., tap-tap-tap-tap quickly and loudly on a drum, or rapid claps).  
  * Ask: How would a slow, uneven rhythm with soft dynamics show a challenge in building or a quiet new idea forming?  
    * Encourage students to experiment with slow, soft, irregular rhythms, e.g., STOMP…quiet tap…STOMP slowly and softly, or a slow, sighing hum).  
* Guide students to experiment with their instruments to make these rhythms and dynamics, linking them to the ideas of work (e.g., busy, tired, efficient, struggling).  
* *Melody and Harmony:* Melody is the tune (the part you might hum), and harmony is when different notes or voices sound good together.  
  * Ask: How would a simple, happy melody (high or low) show a new invention working perfectly, or a resilient bridge standing strong?  
    * Encourage students to create simple rising hums like do-re-mi, or cheerful la-la-la phrases.  
  * Ask: How could different voices or instruments playing simple sounds together (e.g., one group hums a low note, another a high note) show teamwork and how different parts of a project fit together perfectly?  
    * Guide students to experiment with layering simple sustained notes.  
* Have students explore simple melodies and layering sounds, connecting them to ideas of progress and collaboration.  
* *Form and Structure:* Form is how a piece of music is organized into different sections, like a song having a verse and chorus, or a clear beginning and end.  
  * Ask: How could you use two different musical sections (e.g., an “A” part that’s chaotic and a “B” part that’s organized) to show a problem in industry and then a solution?  
    * Have students try moving from one contrasting musical idea to another (e.g., messy banging followed by a calm, steady beat on their instrument), showing a story with musical sections.  
* *Timbre:* Timbre is the unique sound quality of an instrument or voice (what makes a drum sound different from a shaker, or your voice different from a robot’s). Sound effects can also be discussed.  
  * Ask: What instrument sounds like heavy construction? What sounds like a new machine humming? What sound effect can you make for a lightbulb turning on or a robot whirring?  
    * Have students explore different instrument sounds and vocal sound effects, linking them to specific objects or actions in industry/innovation.  
* Guide students to experiment with their instruments and voices to demonstrate how these different musical elements can tell a story about industry, innovation, and infrastructure. This serves as an integrated brainstorming process, where ideas for content are directly explored through musical means.

**Music and Global Goal 9**  
Explain that the class will now apply the musical elements they’ve explored to tell stories about Global Goal 9\.  
*Rhythms of Progress*

* Create a rhythm that starts slow and simple, then gradually becomes faster and more complex, representing the progress and development of industry and technology. Instruct students to echo your rhythm.  
* Then, lead a call-and-response activity where a rhythm is created to represent a challenge (e.g., a broken machine→clunk-clunk-silence), and students can one by one echo a rhythm represents a solution (e.g., whirr-buzz-ding\!). Repeat this with a few different challenge/solution rhythms, giving a number of students a chance to create a solution rhythm.  
  * Examples of Challenge Rhythms: slow, heavy thud (old infrastructure), fast, erratic clicking (confusing tech), chaotic banging (noisy factory).  
  * Examples of Solution Rhythms: smooth, steady hum (efficient new machine), bright, clear bell tones (new idea), strong, unified beat (resilient building).

*Melodies of Innovation*

* Lead a vocal exploration where a simple, uplifting melody or phrase that evokes hope and optimism for new ideas is sung. Instruct students to echo it back, experimenting with different dynamics and expressions.  
* Then create a melody that starts with a single note, gradually adding more notes and simple harmonies, representing the growth and interconnectedness of sustainable industries. Instruct students to follow lead, adding their parts.  
  * Examples of Melodies: Short, rising vocal phrases, simple do-re-mi melodies that sound hopeful, a simple melody that changes from sad to happy.

*Harmony of Collaboration*

* Guide students to sing or play simple harmonies or chords together, emphasizing how each part contributes to the overall sound, symbolizing collaboration and interconnectedness in building the future (e.g., guide one group to hum a low note, another a middle, another a high, forming a simple chord).  
  * Ask: How does our music sound stronger when we play/sing different parts together? How is this like different people working together on a big project?

*Dynamics of Impact*

* Lead students in experimenting with different dynamics while singing or playing instruments, creating contrasts that represent the power and impact of industry and innovation. Guide them to create a musical phrase that starts very quietly, then builds to a powerful crescendo (representing a new invention taking off), then fades to a calm, steady sound (representing sustainable impact).  
  * Ask: How did changing the loudness of our music make you feel the power of innovation?

*Sound Effects for a Smarter World*

* Have students create sound effects using their voices, body percussion, or classroom objects to represent the sounds of construction, transportation, or technology that makes things better (e.g., whirr for a robot, whoosh for a high-speed train, ding\! For an idea, clunk-clunk for a strong and safe bridge).  
* Instruct students to play these sounds together to create a short sound picture of a smarter, more innovative world.

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did creating and exploring sounds \- using rhythm, melody, harmony, and dynamics \- help you to understand the themes of Global Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure in a new way?  
* What did you learn about how different musical elements can represent specific aspects of Global Goal 9, such as the consistent work of a factory, the sudden burst of innovation, or the complexity of interconnected infrastructure?  
* Did the activity change how you perceive the sounds around you in your daily life? Do you think you will now hear “music” or patterns in everyday industry and technology?  
* How did actively making music, rather than just listening, deepen your personal connection to Global Goal 9?  
* What did you learn about the power of music and sound to evoke emotions and communicate messages about progress, challenges, and sustainability?  
* What is one key takeaway about industry, innovation, and infrastructure that you will remember from this musical exploration?  
* How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in fostering innovation or supporting sustainable infrastructure in your community?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including warm up, musical concept explorations, and class discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concept of industry, innovation, and infrastructure (building, new ideas, fair industry), as demonstrated through the musical choices (e.g., specific rhythms, melodies, dynamics used during experimentation) and verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effectiveness in applying chosen musical concepts (rhythm, melody, harmony, dynamics, timbre, sound effects) to represent ideas about Global Goal 9 during the guided applications. Look for clear intent and expression in the musical contributions.  
* Ability to work effectively as a class, listening to each other’s contributions, responding musically, and contributing to the cohesive overall sound during explorations and applications.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

**Introduction**

`	`Begin by introducing Global Goal 15. Explain that this goal is about protecting the land we live on, big and small. It’s about taking care of all the plants and animals that call these places home.

`	`Introduce the concept of “Follow the Leader” as a way to explore these big ideas. Explain that this is not just a dance/movement game; it’s a way to work together as a group to tell an embodied story. The focus is on creativity, simple movements, and group cooperation.

`	`Demonstrate a few simple dance movements, and have students follow with prompts like:

- Follow my movements as I show the gentle sway of a tree in the wind.
  - Flowing, graceful movements.
- Follow me as I show the sharp, quick movements of a small lizard.
  - Quick, jerky movements.
- Follow me as I show the slow, steady growth of a plant.
  - Start small and expand movements slowly.

`	`These examples will help students understand they are not just copying movements, but embodying an idea through dance.

**The Living Landscape Journey**

`	`Lead the class through a series of “Follow the Leader” sequences, each focusing on a different aspect of Global Goal 15. To ensure a clear progression through the lesson’s themes, students will not lead during this section.

`	`Examples:

- *The Healthy Forest (Targets 15.1/15.2)*
  - Begin with music that evokes a calm, peaceful forest. 

    Example Music:

    - “[Forest Lullaby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPTh2zvSbb0)*,”* Lesfm
    - “[Under The Water It Glowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r1CWc899zs)*”,* Eluvium
    - [*Celtic Forest Music*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yTLaqO5kmA&t=1207s), Adrian von Ziegler
  - As the leader, use flowing, upright movements to represent tall trees. Sway arms like branches int he wind. Crouch down and use small, quick movements to be a scurrying forest animal. With all movements, establish a sense of harmony and biodiversity, ensuring the group is following your lead.

    Example Prompt:

    - Let’s all become a forest. Follow my movements as we sway and grow together.
- *The Threat of Habitat Loss (Targets 15.2/15.5)*
  - Change the music to something more tense or jarring. 

    Example Music:

    - “[The Imperial March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7HF4JG1pOg),” from Star Wars, John Williams
    - “[The Rite of Spring - Sacrificial Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiH3vA7q0jo),” Igor Stravinsky
    - “[Main Title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BePfzCOMRZQ)” from Jaws, John Williams
  - As the leader, use sharp, aggressive movements, like a chainsaw cutting through a tree or a bulldozer clearing land. Use jerky, constricted movements to show an animal trying to escape. With all movements ensure the impact of deforestation and habitat loss is embodied.

    Example Prompt:

    - A threat is entering our forest. Follow me as I show a big, loud machine cutting down trees. How does an animal move when its home is gone?
- *The Promise of Restoration (Targets 15.3/15.5)*
  - Change the music to a hopeful and uplifting track. 

    Example Music:

    - “[Arrietty’s Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7q07dyIsX8)” from The Secret World of Arrietty, Cecile Corbel
    - “[Feather Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOvuwNyhcqI)” from Forrest Gump, Alan Silvestri
    - “[Main Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYEwFDLVnM)” from Lord of the Rings, Howard Shore
  - As the leader, start in a low, small position. Use slow, upward, and expansive movements to represent a new plant sprouting and a forest growing back. With all movements, embody the feeling of hope and resilience.

    Example Prompt:

    - The land can heal. Follow me as I show a new plant growing from the ground. We are helping the land come back to life.

`	`Throughout this activity, emphasize that the movements are not about perfection, but about expressing the important story through dance and movement. Encourage students to feel the difference between the flowing movements of a healthy forest and the sharp aggressive movements of a threat.

**Creative Follow the Leader**

`	`Now, students will have the chance to be the leader. Divide the the class into small groups (3-4 students), and have each group select one student in their group to be the leader.

`	`Have each group choose a theme from Global Goal 15 to explore. They can pull from the themes learned about in the last activity, or a new idea related to Global Goal 15 that the group comes up with (e.g., animals living in a grassland, the struggle of a mountain goat, a mouse fleeing his home in the forest, the spread of invasive species, etc.).

`	`The student leader will create a short sequence of movements to represent that theme. The other students in the group will follow the leader through the dance/movements.

`	`Encourage students to be creative with their movements/dances. They can use different speeds, levels (high/low), and directions.

`	`After a few minutes, have the groups pass the leader position to someone else in the group. Continue this process ensuring everyone gets a chance to lead and follow.

**The Performance and Discussion**

`	`After all groups have rotated through their leaders, invite groups to share their “Follow the Leader” stories with the whole class by asking guiding questions like:

- What story did did your group tell?
- What movements within your group stood out to you?
- How did this “Follow the Leader” story make you think or feel about Global Goal 15?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using your body to move and dance help you understand a big idea like Global Goal 15? Did it feel different from just reading about it?
- What did you learn about the importance of being a good leader and a good follower?
- How does this lesson show us that we all have a role to play in protecting the environment, both by taking action and supporting others who are?
- How did this lesson change the way you think about dance and movement? Do you think you’ll notice more about the way animals and plants move?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warmup, guided movement explorations, the Creative Follow the Leader activity, and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 themes (e.g., forest ecosystems, biodiversity loss, desertification, conservation) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in movement and verbal explanations during discussion.
- Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract concepts related to life on land into dance and movement, both following and leading.
- How clearly and powerfully the movements communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 15. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion related to life on land?
- Ability to work effectively as a class and in small groups, demonstrating attentive listening when following, clear initiation when leading, and maintaining a cohesive group dynamic throughout the activity.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life on land.

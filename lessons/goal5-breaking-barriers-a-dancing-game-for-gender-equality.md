**Introduction**

Begin by having students pair up and face each other, ensuring enough space for movement.

Explain the concept of mirroring, where one person initiates movements and the other reflects them as accurately as possible. Show example if necessary.

Emphasize the importance of focus, observation, and nonverbal communication.

You can set a calm and focused tone with soft background music or simply guide students to take a few deep breaths before starting.

Song Examples:

- ["Moonlight Sonata" by Ludwig van Beethoven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU)
- ["Pachelbel's Canon in D" by Johann Pachelbel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nX_ReyaetE)
- ["Weightless" by Marconi Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU)
- [“Ocean Eyes” by Billie Eilish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viimfQi_pUw)
- [“Cranes in the Sky” Instrumental by Solange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8aBXQSuWv4)
- [“Slow Dancing in the Dark” Instrumental by Joji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIM2Bl2nbsY)
- [“Liability” by Lorde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvJaNeELic)
- [“Youth” by Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwCTqYMVWo)
- [“River” by Leon Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hegd4xNfRo)

Encourage the leaders to start with simple, slow, and deliberate movements, gradually increasing complexity as they gain confidence. This allows the followers to observe and respond effectively.

Suggest exploring different parts of the body and movement qualities:

- *Body Parts:* Head, arms, torso, legs, facial expressions.
- *Movement Qualities:* Smooth, sharp, flowing, staccato, sustained, percussive.

Encourage leaders to infuse their movements with emotions, and followers to try and capture those emotions in their mirroring.

After a few minutes, have partners switch roles, allowing everyone to experience both leading and following.

Encourage students to observe how their experience changes when they switch roles.

Feel free to introduce variations like mirroring with eyes closed or adding a slight delay in the mirroring to increase the challenge and focus on intuition.

When finished, open a discussion about the experience, asking questions like:

- How did it feel to lead? How did it feel to follow? Was one role more challenging than the other?
- How did you communicate with your partner without words? What cues did you pay attention to?
- Did you feel a sense of connection with your partner during the mirroring exercise? How did it feel to try to understand and express their movements and emotions?
- What were some of the challenges you faced? What moments felt particularly successful or rewarding?

Transition to re-introducing Global Goal 5 by explaining how the mirroring exercise related to understanding and empathizing with others, a crucial aspect of achieving gender equality.

If needed, present the Global Goal: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”

Explain Global Goal 5’s importance by discussing how gender equality benefits everyone, creating a fairer and more just world where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Examples of prompts to open the discussion:

- What does gender equality mean to you? 
  - Encourage a brief brainstorm, allowing for diverse perspectives and interpretations.
- Lead the discussion towards the broader benefits of gender equality, using relatable examples and questions:
  - "Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their gender, has the same opportunities and rights. Wouldn't that be a fairer world?"
  - "How might gender inequality affect not only girls and women, but also boys and men?"
  - "Studies show that when women have equal access to education and jobs, economies thrive. How do you think empowering women can benefit our society as a whole?"
  - "Can you think of any examples of successful women leaders or entrepreneurs who have made a positive impact?"
  - "When women and girls are empowered, they can contribute their unique perspectives and talents to their communities. How might this create stronger and more resilient communities?"
  - "Can you think of any ways in which gender stereotypes or biases might limit the potential of individuals or communities?"
  - "Gender equality allows everyone to pursue their dreams and reach their full potential, regardless of societal expectations. How can breaking free from gender stereotypes lead to greater happiness and fulfillment for individuals?"

**Movement Game: The Equality Obstacle Course**

**Set Up**

- Create multiple obstacle courses using cones or floor markers, each representing a different Global Goal 5 Target (as many or as few as you wish.)
- Designate specific obstacles within each course to represent challenges related to that Target.

Examples:

- *Target 5.1 (Discrimination)*
  - A line of cones or floor markers representing a barrier or closed door.
    - Setup: Place a line of cones/floor markers/tape/etc. across the room, leaving a small gap at one end.
- *Target 5.2 (Violence)*
  - A confined space representing feeling trapped.
    - Setup: Use cones/floor markers/tape/etc. to create a small, enclosed area on the floor.
- *Target 5.3 (Harmful Practices)*
  - A winding path representing societal pressure.
    - Setup: Arrange cones/floor markers/tape/etc. in a zigzag pattern on the floor.
- *Target 5.4 (Unpaid Care Work)*
  - A pile of objects (beanbags/balls/etc.) representing endless chores.
    - Setup: Place a pile of objects in the center of the room/designated space.
- *Target 5.5 (Leadership)*
  - A raised platform representing leadership positions.
    - Setup: Use a stable platform/chair/etc. to create an elevated surface.
- *Target 5.6 (Reproductive Health)*
  - A maze of representing misinformation and stigma.
    - Arrange cones/floor markers/tape/etc. in a maze-like pattern.
- *Target 5.a (Economic Resources)*
  - A beam or line on the floor representing financial instability.
    - Place a beam or mark a straight line on the floor with tape, etc.
- *Target 5.b (Technology)*
  - Pieces of paper scattered on the floor representing access points to technology and/or digital information.
    - Scatter pieces of paper across the designated space.
- *Target 5.c (Policies and Legislation)*
  - A tangled rope/scarf/etc. representing bureucratic hurdles.
    - Tie a rope/scarf/fabric/etc. between two objects, creating a tangled web that students must navigate through.

Divide the class into groups, ideally 3-4 students per group.

Explain the game:

- Each group will rotate through all the obstacle courses, experiencing the challenges associated with different targets.
- One person from each group will navigate a course at a time, embodying a character affected by the Target’s challenge.
- The rest of the group will act as guides and supporters, offering verbal encouragement and helping their teammate brainstorm movements or actions to overcome each obstacle.
- Emphasize that there are no right or wrong answers, and encourage creativity and expression in movement.
- If obstacle’s are moved/broken during a students “run”, students will be responsible to “reset” them.

[Variation] Blindfolded Trust: Have one person in each group blindfolded, representing the vulnerability faced by women and girls. The other group members must guide the blindfolded person through the obstacle using only verbal communication.

Open a discussion, with questions like:

- How did it feel to be blindfolded and reliant on others?
- How did it feel to guide someone and ensure their safety?
- How does this relate to the importance of support and allyship in achieving gender equality?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did physically navigating the obstacle course help you understand the barriers and challenges related to different aspects of gender inequality?
- What emotions did you experience while embodying someone facing these obstacles, and how did that connect you to the real-world struggles?
- How did being blindfolded (if applicable) highlight the importance of support, communication, and vulnerability in the context of gender equality?
- How did the collective expereince of navigating the course together, even individually, reflect the need for solidarity and allyship in achieving gender equality?
- How did the physical challenges of the courses relate to the real-world difficulties faced in achieving gender equality in those areas?
- What did you notice about the different kinds of support and guidance that were offered within your groups as individuals navigated the obstacles?
- How did the movement highlight the need for both individual strength and collective action in breaking down barriers to gender equality?
- What did the experience of both facing and helping others overcome obstacles teach you about the complexities of achieving a gender-equal world?
- Did any of the obstacles or the expereince of navigating them resonate with your own experiences or observations related to gender equality?
- What did you learn about your own capacity for empathy and support while guiding your teammates?
- How has this experience influenced your thinking about the importance of taking action to promote gender equality?
- What is one key takeaway about the challenges and the necessity of working together to achieve gender equality that you will remember from this lesson? 

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the “Mirror, Mirror” warm-up, the “Equality Obstacle Course” game, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 5, targets and core concepts (e.g., discrimination, violence, harmful practices, leadership, economic resources, non-discrimination). This will be evidenced through the symbolism and intention within movement through the obstacle course and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in using movement and body language to represent specific challenges (e.g., navigating a barrier, feeling trapped) and solutions (e.g., pushing forward, supporting a teammate) related to gender inequity.
- How clearly and powerfully the embodied experience communicated its intended message about gender equality. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the struggles and triumphs?
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, offering verbal encouragement, brainstorming movement solutions, and demonstrating effective teamwork, especially during the “Blindfold Trust” variation, if implemented.
- Willingness and ability to physically inhabit and interpret the experience of challenges, fostering a deeper sense of empathy for those facing gender-based inequalities.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of embodied learning in comprehending gender inequity.

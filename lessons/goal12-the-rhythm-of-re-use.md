## **The Rhythm of Re-use**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

A variety of percussion instruments (drums, shakers, woodblocks, etc.)
Recycled materials that can be used as instruments (buckets, bottles, cans, cardboard boxes)

Audio
Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

Pens/Pencils




**Introduction**

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Emphasize its importance in achieving a sustainable future. Briefly review and explain some of the key targets.
Facilitate a class discussion.

- What are some of the sounds you might associate with consumption? (e.g., packaging being opened, machines running, vehicles)?
- What are some of the sounds you associate with sustainability? (e.g., nature sounds, renewable energy sources, recycling processes)?
- How can music and sound be used to represent these different aspects of consumption and production?

Introduce musical concepts and explain the concept of a “circular rhythm” as a metaphor for the circular economy.

- In music, a circular rhythm is a pattern that repeats and returns to its starting point. It can represent the idea of materials flowing in a closed floop, rather than being discarded as waste.

Introduce basic rhythmic concepts

- *Beat:* The steady pulse of the music.
- *Rhythm:* The arrangement of sounds and silences.
- *Ostinato:* A repeated musical pattern.

Demonstrate simple circular rhythms using percussion instruments.

Example:

- *Instrument 1:* Plays a steady beat on a drum.
- *Instrument 2:* Plays a short rhythmic pattern on a shaker that repeats.
- *Instrument 3:* Adds a different pattern on a woodblock, also repeating.

Explain how these rhythms can be layered and combined to create a more complex musical piece.

**Group Exploration and Composition**

Divide students into small groups (4-5 students)

Assign each group a specific target or aspect of Global Goal 12 to focus on, or let groups focus on the Goal as a whole. Examples:

- *Group 1:* Sustainable Use of Natural Resources (Target 12.2)
- *Group 2:* Food Waste Reduction (Target 12.3)
- *Group 3:* Sustainable Product Design (Connecting to Targets 12.5 and 12.6)
- *Group 4:* Consumer Awareness (Target 12.8)
- *Group 5:* Renewable Energy (Connecting to Targets 12.a and 12.c)

Each group will:

Discuss and lightly research their assigned aspect of Goal 12.

Brainstorm sounds and rhythms that represent their topic.

Examples:

- *Group 1 (Natural Resources):* Sounds of flowing water, wind, deforestation, mining.
- *Group 2 (Food Waste):* Sounds of chopping, eating, discarding, composting.
- *Group 3 (Sustainable Design):* Rhythms using recycled materials, representing durability and reuse.
- *Group 4 (Consumer Awareness):* Rhythms that reflect the influence of advertising, the power of choice.
- *Group 5 (Renewable Energy):* Sounds of wind turbines, solar panels, flowing electricity.

Select instruments (including recycled materials) to create their rhythms.

Compose a short musical phrase or ostinato (4-8 beats) that represents their topic.

Consider how their rhythm could be layered and combined with the rhythms of other groups.

**Circular Rhythm Performance**

Each group performs their rhythm for the class.

Guide the class in gradually layering the rhythms, creating a “circular rhythm piece”.

- Start with one group’s rhythm, then add another, and another, building up the complexity.
- Encourage students to listen carefully to how the different rhythms interact.
- Explore variations in tempo, dynamics (loudness/softness), and texture (timbre), to create musical interest.

The piece can end with all groups playing together, representing the interconnectedness of all aspects of sustainable consumption and production.

**Reflection and Discussion**

Facilitate a discussion about the musical experience. Ask questions like:

- How did the different rhythms represent the various aspects of Global Goal 12?
- How did the “circular rhythm” concept relate to the idea of a circular economy?
- What did you learn about the power of music to communicate complex ideas?
- How can music inspire action for a more sustainable future?

Connect the musical experience to Global Goal 12.

Example:

- The layered rhythms can represent the interconnectedness of production and consumption. The use of recycled materials as instruments can highlight the importance of reducing waste.


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did creating a “circular rhythm piece” help you to understand the concept of a circular economy and its connection to responsible consumption and production?
- What did you learn about how different sounds and rhythms can represent various aspects of sustainability, like resource use, waste reduction, or renewable energy?
- Did using recycled materials as instruments change your perspective on waste or the potential for reuse?
- How did the layering of different rhythms within the piece reflect the interconnectedness of the various targets within Global Goal 12?
- What did you discover about the power of music to communicate complex ideas in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns through this musical exploration?
- How did focusing on specific concepts within Global Goal 12 help you to translate abstract concepts into concrete sounds and rhythms?
- Did the activity make you think differently about your own relationship with consumption and its impact on the environment?
- How can music help us to imagine and create a more sustainable future?
- Did creating and performing your rhythmic piece spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with consumption or waste?
- What emotions did you connect with during this musical activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 12?
- What is one key takeaway about responsible consumption and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial brainstorming, rhythm exploration, collaborative composition, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 12, targets and core concepts. This will be evidenced through the symbolism and intention within their rhythmic patterns and their verbal explanations during sharing and discussion.
- Originality and effectiveness in crafting rhythmic phrases or ostinatos, using body percussion or improvised instruments to convey messages about responsible consumption and production.
- How clearly and powerfully the collective rhythmic piece communicated its intended message about Global Goal 12. Did the combined sounds successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the goal?
- Ability to work effectively within the groups, contributing ideas, listening to others’ musical contributions, and collaborating cohesively to create the layered rhythm.
- Ability to maintain a steady beat, execute rhythmic patterns with reasonable precision, and blend sounds effectively within the ensemble, demonstrating musical awareness.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of music in advocating for sustainable development and the complexities of consumption patterns.

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Audio

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

Pens/Pencils

[Optional] Simple percussion instruments (hand drums, shakers, rhythm sticks, etc.) or a piano/keyboard to play a simple blues backing track

**Introduction**

`	`Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use the power of song to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.

`	`Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promised to build cities and towns that are great places to live for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities that are:

- *Inclusive:* Welcoming and fair for all people.
- *Safe:* Places where everyone feels secure.
- *Resilient:* Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.
- *Sustainable:* Good for the planet and for people for a long time.

`	`Begin with a brief introduction to the blues. Explain that the blues is a very special kind of music that started a long time ago in America. Clarify that the blues is all about telling a story with music, especially a story about a problem, and then finding a way to feel better, or find hope and strength, even when things are tough. Explain that the blues is a powerful way to express feelings and give a voice to people’s challenges.

`	`Play examples of age-appropriate, classic blues or blues inspired songs, highlighting the emotional depth and storytelling aspect of the genre.

`	`Examples:

- [“Everyday I Have the Blues”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4tL-zeVRbk)*,* B.B. King
- [“Walking Blues”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEsQikthT3Q)*,* Robert Johnson
- [“Give Me One Reason”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6hQ9HSKlIE)*,* Tracy Chapman
- [“Hound Dog”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmpwvxW0gW0),* Big Mama Thornton
- [“Mean Old Bedbug Blues”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vchl9yUo3Fo), Bessie Smith

`	`Guide students to think abou the emotions and stories in the songs, asking guiding questions like:

- What emotions do you hear in these songs? Do you hear sadness, strength, or maybe a little bit of both?
- How does the music make you feel? Does it sound heavy or strong?
- What kind of story do you think the singer is telling?

**Warm Up: Blues Feelings and Motions**

`	`Explain that the Blues connects a feeling to a rhythm, and that in this warm up the class will listen to a basic blues progression and move in a way that expresses the feelings that naturally come from the song.

`	`Play a simple, instrumental blues progression.

`	`Example

- [12 Bar Blues Backing Track in A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3AbKYn0gwY)
- [Shuffle 12 Bar Blues in E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7b9qqcT4M)
- [Classic 12 Bar Blues in C Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnXVrMbnyLU)
- [Bb - Medium Tempo 12 Bar Blues Backing Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpTr1lfG0WY)

`	`*Listen to the Feeling*

- Instruct students to move their body in a way that expresses the feeling of the blues.
- Ask guiding questions while the movement is happening, like:
  - The blues often starts with a feeling of sadness or frustration, what does that look like in your body?
  - Do you move slowly?
  - Is it a heavy feeling?
  - Is it a tired feeling?
- Encourage students to move in a way that expresses this feeling, whether with a full body motion or a small finger tap.

`	`*Move to the Beat*

- Instruct students to let their body movements follow the beat and rhythm of the song. Explain that the rhythm of the blues is a repeating pattern that is often slow and steady. 
- Encourage students to move in a way that follows this rhythm, allowing them to feel the emotions of the song.

`	`*Find the Hope*

- Instruct students to shift their movements to a more hopeful and determined feeling.
- Ask guiding questions while the movement is happening, like:
  - The blues is not just about sadness, it is also about hope and resilience. How does your body move when it feels hopeful?
  - Is it a stronger movement?
  - Is it a more open movement?
- Encourage students to move in a way that expresses this feeling, allowing them to feel the emotions of the song.

`	`Conclude warm up by affirming the connection students have made to the musical structure of the blues, and their ability to translate abstract feelings and emotions into concrete musical ideas, a foundational skill for writing and performing the blues.

**Blues and Global Goal 11**

`	`Explain that the blues is a perfect medium for telling stories about cities and communities. Clarify that blues songs often use a simple structure to tell a story:

- Line A (a problem)
- Line A (the same problem, maybe with a small change)
- Line B (a solution or a hope)

`	`Explain this AAB structure in a simple, relatable way. You can reference some of the original song examples from the beginning of the lesson, or give a simple, non-Global Goal 11 example if helpful:

- My dog ran away and hid down the street *(A)*
- My dog ran away he just wanted a treat *(A)*
- I found him with a bone, my day’s now complete *(B)*

`	`Then connect this structure to Global Goal 11. Ask students to think about problems and hopes in their own cities and communities, asking guiding questions like:

- What’s a problem you’ve seen in our city or community?
- What’s a hope or a solution for that problem?

`	`Explain that they will use these ideas to write their own blues songs.

**Lyric Writing and Blues Structure**

`	`Explain that students will now write their own blues lyrics that fit the simple AAB structure.

`	`Students can work in pairs or in small groups (choose the option that best fits the needs of your students).

`	`Play a simple, instrumental 12-bar blues backing track in the background.

`	`Examples

- [12 Bar Blues Backing Track in A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3AbKYn0gwY)
- [Shuffle 12 Bar Blues in E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7b9qqcT4M)
- [Classic 12 Bar Blues in C Major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnXVrMbnyLU)
- [Bb - Medium Tempo 12 Bar Blues Backing Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpTr1lfG0WY)

`	`Provide examples of lyrics for inspiration if needed, covering various aspects of Global Goal 11 (can be written on the whiteboard/large paper for students to reference).

- *For Safe Cities*
  - Streetlights are all out, and the night feels so dark

    Streetlights are all out, and the night feels so dark

    I wish I had a light, like a tiny little spark.

- *For Green Spaces*
  - All the trees are gone now, not a green leaf in sight

    All the trees are gone now, not a green leaf in sight

    I’m planting a new one, to make our city bright

- *For Community*
  - I saw a sad person, sitting all alone

    I saw a sad person, yes they were on their own

    I sat down beside them, and our friendship has grown.

- *For Sustainable Transport* 
  - The bus is always late, and it’s puffin’ out smoke

    The bus is always late, and it’s puffin’ ‘out smoke

    My feet are gonna walk, my knees won’t go broke

- *For Clean Cities*
  - Trash piles up high, fills the streets and the air

    Trash piles u so high, fills up the streets and the air

    Let’s clean it all up, let’s show that we care

- *For Strong Cities*
  - The old bridge creaks and moans, ready to fall

    The old bridge creaks and moans, ready to fall

    We’re fixin’ it up, so we can stand strong and tall

- *For Inclusive Cities*
  - A new friend came to town, and they don’t know my name

    A new friend came to town, and they don’t know my name

    Let’s all play together, and start a brand new fun game

`	`Sing one of the simple examples along with the backing track, so students can understand how the AAB format fits within the chosen track.

`	`Instruct students to choose a problem and a hope, and write 2-3 verses in the AAB form. Encourage them to:

- Use vivid imagery and emotional language
- Focus on a simple story from their own community, or that they have imagined.
- Use the beat of the blues track to guide their writing.

`	`Circulate, offering guidance and encouragement, asking guiding questions like:

- What’s a problem you see in your neighborhood that could be a blues song?
- How can you write a third line that shows hope or a solution?
- Are you using words that make us feel the emotion of the song?

`	`Have each pair/group perform their blues song, singing along to the backing track.

`	`Play the simple 12-bar blues progression repeatedly in the background for each performance.

`	`After each performance, ask the class to offer positive feedback, questions, and encouragement. Guide the conversation with guiding questions like:

- What problem did you hear in the song?
- What solution or hope did you hear in the third line?
- How did their voice(s) make you feel the emotion of the song?
- What kind of story did their blues song tell about a city or community?
- How did their song make you think about Global Goal 11?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

## **Curating Playlists for a Gender-Equal World**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials**

Audio

Devices with internet access (smartphones, tablets, or computers)

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

**Introduction**

Begin by playing a song that is known for its message of empowerment or challenging societal/gender norms, preferably one with a strong female artist or perspective.

Song Examples:

- Respect, Aretha Franklin
- Run the World (Girls), Beyoncé
- Confident, Demi Lovato
- This Is Me, Keala Settle (from The Greatest Showman)
- Roar, Katy Perry
- Fight Song, Rachel Platten
- Girl on Fire, Alicia Keys
- Brave, Sara Bareilles
- Rise Up, Andra Day

After playing the song(s), facilitate a discussion to unpack the message and connect it to the broader theme of gender equality. Ask guiding questions like:

- How did this song make you feel? Did it make you feel strong, brave, or happy? What parts of the music (like the beat, the singing, etc.) make you feel that way?
- What do you think the main message of the song is? What is the singer trying to tell us?
- Are there any specific words or phrases in the song that stood out to you? Why?
- How can this song’s message relate to the idea of fairness and equal chances for everyone, no matter their gender?
- Can you think of other songs that make you feel strong or happy, or that talk about important ideas?

**Warm Up: Musical Mood Match**

Play short snippets of different types of instrumental music. For each snippet, instruct students to think about how the music makes them feel (happy, calm, energetic, worried, strong, etc.). 

Then, instruct them to make a quick, simple sound or movement (without standing) that shows that feeling.

*Upbeat/Joyful*

- Play 15-20 seconds of an upbeat, happy instrumental track.

  Examples:

  - [“Can’t Stop the Feeling!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdCrhwDW8hA)
  - [“Walking on Sunshine”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9q3DLWltnc)
- Ask: How does this music make you feel? What movement/sound shows that feeling?

  Examples:

  - Bouncy movements, big smiles, light claps, cheerful hums.

*Calm/Peaceful*

- Play 15-20 seconds of a calm, flowing instrumental track.

  Examples:

  - [“Path of the Wind”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZgBjQFMPvk)
  - [“Comptine d’un autre été, l’après-midi”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znfYwABeSZ0&list=OLAK5uy_lmQQgG50xt5GkVn8xwT1kq_b4a79dOQpo&index=3)
- Ask: How does this music make you feel? What movement/sound shows that feeling?

  Examples:

  - Slow sway, gentle breathing and singing, relaxed shoulders, soft hums.

*Determined/Strong*

- Play 15-20 seconds of an empowering, building instrumental track.

  Examples:

  - [“Titanium Pavane”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz4MzJTeL0c)
  - [“The Phantom of the Opera”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpbX7SbXOtU)
- Ask: How does this music make you feel? What movement/sound shows that feeling?

  Examples:

  - Furrowed brows, scratching head, questioning hums and singing, slow uncertain steps.

*Challenging/Puzzled*

- Play 15-20 seconds of a tense, mysterious track.

  Examples:

  - [“Lacrimosa”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDsOuoD9R-A)
  - [“In the Hall of the Mountain King”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s-Kz8S4dYw&list=PLCA8137EE9E44A5A8&index=2)
- Ask: How does this music make you feel? What movement/sound shows that feeling?

  Examples:

  - Furrowed brows, scratching head, questioning hums and singing, slow uncertain steps.

Affirm students’ ability to connect music to emotions, explaining that they will use this skill to create playlists.

**Building Our Fairness Playlist**

Explain that the students will create a song web theme together. 

Draw a large circle in the center of the whiteboard/paper. Write “Gender Equality” inside.

Then draw several branches from the center, labeling them with different aspects of fairness and equality.

- *Branch 1: Feeling Strong and Brave* (e.g., standing up for yourself, being a leader, finding your voice.)
- *Branch 2: Being Fair and Respectful* (e.g., treating everyone equally, sharing opportunities, listening to all voices).
- *Branch 3: Celebrating Differences and Being Unique* (e.g., showing that it’s cool to like different things, everyone belongs, accepting all talents and differences).
- *Branch 4: Working Together* (e.g., teamwork, helping each other, solving problems as a group)

For each branch, ask: What kind of song would fit this theme? Think about the beat (slow/fast), the instruments you’d hear, the singer’s voice (strong/soft), and the kinds of words you’d expect to hear in the lyrics. Write these musical qualities under each theme on the web.

Examples:

- *Feeling Strong and Brave:* Fast beat, strong drums, powerful voice, words like “fight,” “rise,” “can do,” “unbreakable.”
- *Being Fair and Respectful:* Steady beat, calm music, kind voice, words about “listen,” “share,” “together,” “equal.”
- *Celebrating Differences and Being Unique:* Upbeat tempo, lots of different instruments, playful voice, words about “shine,” “different,” “sparkle,” “me.”
- *Working Together:* Strong, marching beat, many instruments playing together, voices singing together (chorus), words about “team,” “build,” “help,” “hand in hand.”

Summarize: This web gives us a great starter map for finding amazing songs for our playlists.

**Playlist Creation: Songs for Fairness and Strength**

Divide students into groups of 3-4.

Assign each group one of the themes from the song theme web.

Challenge each group to create a playlist of 2-3 songs that represent their assigned theme related to Global Goal 5. Emphasize they can choose songs they already know or explore new ones on whatever platform you are having them use (Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).

Note: For more control, you can also pre-make a curated collection “library” of songs for students to pick from.

Encourage students to consider songs that:

- *Make you feel it:* The song should evoke emotions that connect to their theme (e.g., make you feel strong, make you feel included).
- *Tell a story:* Does the song tell a story about standing up for yourself, helping others, or celebrating uniqueness?
- *Inspire action:* Does the song make you want to do something positive for fairness or respect?
- *Musical elements:* How do the beat, instruments, and singer’s voice help the song connect to the theme?
- *Beyond the literal:* You remind them that a song doesn’t have to explicitly say “gender equality” or even “fairness.” A song about a team winning, or a song about being true to yourself can be perfect!

You can provide recent and popular song examples that align with each theme as prompts, ensuring they are appropriate for your students.

Have each group create a very short write-up (2-3 sentences per song), explaining:

- The theme for their playlist.
- Each songs title and artist.
- How each song (its lyrics, beat, mood, etc.) connects to the theme.
- What emotion or message it makes them feel.

**Presentation and Discussion**

Have all groups present their playlists, where each group presents briefly states their theme, plays about 30 seconds of each song, and gives the information for each song and the connection, etc. conversationally.

Facilitate a class discussion about the playlists after all groups have presented, focusing on common themes, emotions, and new insights. Ask guiding questions like:

- What themes or messages about fairness and equality emerged across the different playlists today?
- How did the music make you feel? Which songs resonated with you the most, and why?
- Did the playlists showcase diverse ways people can feel strong or be treated fairly?
- How did listening to different types of songs help you think about different ways to show fairness or address unfairness?
- What did you learn about how music can help us understand big ideas like gender equality?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did creating a playlist help you understand Global Goal 5: Gender Equality and the feelings connected to fairness and strength?
- What did you learn about the power of music to show big ideas, inspire feelings, and make people think about important topics?
- Which songs or ideas from your classmates’ playlists make you think or feel the most about fairness and respect for all genders, and why?
- What does our activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 5?
- What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to promote gender fairness and respect in your school or home?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, group playlist creation, and class discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of gender equality (fairness, equal opportunities, respect for all genders), as demonstrated through song selections, justifications, and verbal contributions during discussions.
- Originality and effectiveness in selecting songs that meaningfully connect to Global Goal 5 themes. Look for evidence that chosen songs evoke the feeling or idea of the assigned theme (e.g., strength, fairness, unity, etc.), not just literal lyrics.
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing song ideas, respecting diverse musical tastes, and collaborating cohesively to curate and justify the playlist.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

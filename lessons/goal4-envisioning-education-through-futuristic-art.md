## **Envisioning Education Through Futuristic Art**
**(30-60 MINUTES)**   
**Materials**  
Large sheets of paper or poster board  
Variety of art supplies:  
	Markers, paints, colored pencils, charcoal, pastels, etc.  
	Collage materials: magazines, newspapers, recycled materials  
	Digital art tools (if available): tablets, computers with design software  
Notebooks or Paper  
Pens/Pencils  
\[Optional\] Inspirational materials, images or videos showcasing futuristic art or architechture  
**Introduction:**   
	Start by asking students “Imagine you could wave a magic wand and redesign your school. What would you change? What would the ideal school of the future look like?” Give them a few minutes to jot down ideas, then share with a partner or small group.  
	Open the discussion to the whole class. Write down key ideas on the board. Expect to hear things like “no homework\!” but try to steer the conversation towards more visionary thinking. Examples:

* Instead of just asking “What would you change” ask:  
  * If you could invent any technology to help you learn, what would it be?  
  * Imagine schools existed on Mars, how would they be different?  
  * If school was designed to solve the world’s biggest problems, what would it look like?  
* Still acknowledge “no homework” type answers, but then respond with something like:  
  * “Let’s think even bigger. What if school was so engaging, you wanted to keep learning even after the bell rings?”

	Potential Examples of Answers

* Learning Environment  
  * Outdoor classrooms  
  * Learning pods in communities  
  * Smart board that adapt to each student  
  * AI generated lessons  
  * Sensory rooms  
  * Flexible spaces for inclusivity

	“Now that we’ve glimpsed some possibilities, let’s get creative. We’ll use art to design our own visions of the School of the Future, inspired by this Global Goal.”  
**Futuristic Art Exploration**  
	Share images/videos of futuristic art and architecture, focusing on those that depict learning environments or technology. Examples:

* Fortunato Depero, [Grattacieli e tunnel (Skyscrapers and Tunnel)](https://www.italianmodernart.org/depero-and-the-metropolis/), [The New Babel](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Figura-20-Fortunato-Depero-The-New-Babel-Scenario-plastico-mobile-1930-tempera-su_fig12_322015956)  
* Wyndham Lewis, [Workshop](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lewis-workshop-t01931)  
* Giulio d’Anna, [The Swimmer](https://www.readingeagle.com/2015/06/21/art-review-italian-futurism-captures-the-spirit-of-the-mid-20th-century/)  
* [Googie Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture)  
* [Futurist Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist_architecture#:~:text=Futurism%20in%20this%20case%20is,the%20use%20of%20technologically%20advanced) 

Additional Notes About Futurism

* *Emphasis on Dynamism:* Futurism often depicted movement, speed, and the energy of machines and modern life. This can be visually exciting for students, and ties into the idea of progress and change that's inherent in envisioning the future.  
* *Focus on Technology:* Futuristic art often incorporated images of machines, airplanes, cars, etc. This can spark discussion about how tech will shape education (for better or worse).  
* *Not Just "Pretty":* Some Futurist works are intentionally jarring or unsettling. This can be a good conversation starter about the complex emotions the future can evoke (hope, fear, excitement).  
* *Beyond the Italian Movement:* While Italian Futurism is most famous, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, etc. Showing this variety demonstrates that imagining the future is a universal human urge.

	Questions to Deepen Discussion

* Even if students don't like a particular piece, ask: "What about this makes it feel 'futuristic'?"  
* "If this painting was about school, what might it be saying?" (Even abstract works can spark ideas)  
* "Do you think the Futurists were optimistic or pessimistic about the future? How can you tell?"  
* "Can we learn anything from Futurism about how to approach problems today, even if their style is old?"

	Discussion

* What elements make this art feel “futuristic”?  
* How do these artists imagine the future of technology, society, and education?  
* What emotions or ideas do these artworks evoke in you?

**Visionary Creation: School of the Future**  
	Divide students into groups, assigning each a specific Global Goal 4 Target  
	Groups brainstorm how their target might be achieved in the future, then sketch their ideas for a futuristic school or learning environment. Examples:

* *Futuristic Architecture:* Imagine buildings that adapt to learners’ needs, use sustainable energy, or incorporate nature.  
* *Technology Integration:* Envision AI-powered classrooms, holographic teachers, or virtual learning spaces.  
* *Inclusive Design:* Consider how the school would cater to diverse learners, including those with disabilities.

	Groups create their final artwork using chosen materials.  
**Gallery Showcase and Discussion**  
	Each group will present their artwork, explaining their vision for the future of education and how it connects to their assigned Target.  
	Class will discuss both during and after the presentations.  
	Examples for Discussion:

* What elements in the artwork(s) convey a sense of the future?  
* How do these artistic representations differ from our current schools and learning environments?  
* What challenges or opportunities do you see in these futuristic visions of education?  
* Which elements of these artworks resonate with your own ideas about the ideal school?  
* What common themes or ideas emerged across the artworks?  
* What are some of the most innovative and exciting possibilities for the future of education?  
* How might these futuristic learning environments contribute to achieving specific targets of Global Goal 4?  
* Do you think technology will play a positive or negative role in the future of education? Why?  
* What are some potential ethical or social implications of these technological advancements in education?  
* How can we ensure that the future of education is inclusive and equitable for all, regardless of background or abilities?  
* How can you, as students, contribute to making these visions a reality?

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did envisioning the future of education impact your thinking about your own learning journey and what you hope for in your future education?  
* What aspects of the futuristic schools created by your group or others resonated most with your personal learning style and aspirations?  
* Did this activity spark any new ideas or possibilities for your own education that you hadn’t considered before?  
* What did you learn about the different dimensions of “inclusive and equitable quality education” through this activity?  
* How did the futuristic elements you incorporated address the challenges and opportunities outlined in Global Goal 4?  
* How did envisioning your future help you understand the importance and relevance of Global Goal 4 in the present?  
* What role does creativity and innovation play in achieving the ambitious goals of Global Goal 4?

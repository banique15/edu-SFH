- What emotions does this artwork evoke in you?
- What messages or stories do you think the artists are trying to convey about consumption and production?

- What symbols or visual elements stand out to you and what might they represent in the context of responsible consumption?

Emphasize how art can be a powerful tool for expressing ideas, challenging perspectives, and inspiring action around consumption, waste, and sustainability.

**Personal Connection**

- Ask students to reflect on their own consumption habits.
- What are some of the things you consume on a daily basis?
- Have you ever thought about the environmental impact of your consumption?
- Have you witnessed any examples of excessive waste or unsustainable practices in your life or community?

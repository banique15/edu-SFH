## Rhythym Chains: Connecting to Life on Land
**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Audio
Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper 

Pens/pencils

Percussion Instruments, if available (drums, shakers, woodblocks, tambourines, etc.)

Body percussion (clapping, snapping, stomping, patting, etc.)

A small box/bag/container containing “rhythm starter” items related to life on land (e.g., a smooth stone, a small twig, a leaf, a toy animal, etc.)


**Introduction**

	Begin by introducing the concept of a rhythm. Explain that a rhythm is a pattern of sounds. We hear rhythms everywhere in nature, from the tapping of a woodpecker to the pitter-patter of rain.

	Then, introduce Global Goal 15. Explain that this goal is about protecting all the different kinds of life on land, from the animals in a forest to the plants in a desert. This lesson will focus on how rhythm can tell the story of a healthy ecosystem, and what happens when that rhythm is broken.

	Introduce the game Rhythm Telephone. Explain that one person will create a short, simple rhythmic pattern (e.g. clap, snap, stomp) and pass it to the person next to them. That person will then try to repeat the rhythm exactly as they heard it and pass it to the next person.

	The game continues until the rhythm gets back to the very first person. The challenge is to see if the rhythm stays the same or if it changes as it’s passed around the group.

	Demonstrate a simple rhythm, like:

- Clap, clap, stomp
- Snap, clap, clap
- Stomp, stomp, clap

	Have a few students practice repeating and passing the rhythm.

**The Ecosystem Rhythm Circle**

	Take out the bag or container filled with items related to life on land, and let students know they will use this to create and brainstorm rhythms that tell a story about different parts of an ecosystem. Have the class sit in a circle.

	*The Healthy Ecosystem*

- Ask students what sounds they think they would hear in a healthy ecosystem, and prompt them to create a rhythm for it together, using items in the rhythm starter bag.
- Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to a healthy ecosystem.

  Examples:

  - Pull out a smooth stone. Ask guiding questions like:
    - What rhythm does a smooth, solid rock make?
      - A student called on can create a steady, calm rhythm by tapping their leg or desk.
  - Pull out a toy animal. Ask guiding questions like:
    - What rhythm does a deer running through a field make?
      - A student volunteer can create a light, quick rhythm using their feet or hands.
- Have a student volunteer choose a rhythm starter item and create a rhythm. The class can listen and try to repeat the rhythm as a whole group. This helps students feel the rhythm and connect it to a healthy ecosystem.

	*The Threat*

- Ask students what happens when a threat enters an ecosystem, and how they think the rhythm might change?
- Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to an ecosystem encountering a threat.

  Examples:

  - Pull out a crinkled leaf. Ask guiding questions like:
    - What rhythm does a dry, fragile leaf make when it’s stepped on?
      - A student called on can create a sharp, brittle rhythm.
- Have a student volunteer create a rhythm that sounds “unhealthy” or “broken.” The class can listen and try to pass this rhythm around the circle.
- Encourage the class to listen for how the rhythm might get distorted or changed as it’s passed on (and don’t encourage them to correct). This can help them understand how a threat can disrupt a system.

	*The Restoration*

- Ask students how they think a rhythm of hope and healing can be created?
- Pull items out of the bag/container, prompting students to brainstorm rhythms connecting to an ecosystem healing.

  Examples:

  - Pull out a small twig. Ask guiding questions like:
    - What does planting a new tree sound like?
      - A student volunteer can create a strong, simple rhythm to represent planting.
- Have a student volunteer create a rhythm for healing and restoration. Pass this rhythm around the circle. See if this time, the class can keep this rhythm strong and true, which shows the power of a collective effort.

**The Collaborative Rhythm Story**

	Have students break into groups of about 10 students. Each group will work together to create a complete musical composition that tells a story about Global Goal 15.

	Have each group sit in a small circle. Introduce the structure of the rhythmic composition, writing each section on the board for reference if helpful.

	*The Beginning (Healthy Ecosystem)*

- One student in the group will start with a “healthy ecosystem” rhythm (can be taken from the last activity).
- The group will then play the Rhythm Telephone game, passing that rhythm around the circle.

	*The Threat*

- At your signal, the last person to receive the rhythm will start a new, “threat” rhythm. This rhythm will be passed around the circle, showing how a problem can spread and disrupt a system.

	*The Restoration*

- At another signal, the last person to receive the threat rhythm will start a new, “restoration” rhythm. This rhythm will then be passed around the circle, showing how our actions can heal and reshape a problem or threat.

	Continue this cycle as long as time allows/desired.

**A Rhythmic Performance**

	Describe to the class that this final piece will be a short, guided performance. The class will be conducted, and each group will function almost like different sections of an orchestra.

	*Conductor’s Role:* As the conductor, point to different groups of students and have them perform rhythms from their prior small group activity. You can have one group perform their healthy ecosystem rhythm, and another perform their restoration rhythm. Based on students’ needs and abilities, change the tempo and volume to create a dynamic performance.

	The goal is to create a collective piece that tells a story about the challenges and hope for life on land. The class will work together to create a cohesive performance that is more than just a series of individual rhythms.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- What did you learn about how a rhythm can tell a story?
- How did the rhythm of a healthy forest feel different from the rhythm of a threatened one?
- The rhythm changed as it was passed from person to person. How does that show us that our actions, both good and bad, can affect the whole ecosystem?
- What is one thing you will do to help keep the rhythm of our planet healthy?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, from the rhythm brainstorm to the collective rhythm creation and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 themes (e.g., deforestation, biodiversity, conservation) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in rhythm and sound, and verbal explanations during discussion.
- Originality and effectiveness in creating and transforming rhythmic patterns using body percussion or available instruments to represent various aspects of life on land.
- How clearly and powerfully the rhythmic contributions communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 15. Did the rhythmic expressions successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the land?
- Ability to work effectively as a class, demonstrating active listening when receiving rhythms, accurate repetition when passing them, and creative responsiveness during variations and layered compositions.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening and the ability to articulate what was observed and learned from the collective performance.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life on land.

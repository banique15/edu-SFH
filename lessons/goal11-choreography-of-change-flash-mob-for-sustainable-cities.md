**Introduction**

Begin with a brief, engaging introduction about flash mobs: their history, purpose, and impact.

- Imagine you’re walking through a busy public space, and suddenly, a group of people bursts into a coordinated dance. What would you think?
- A flash mob is a large, seemingly spontaneous gathering of people who perform an unusual or entertaining act, then disperse quickly.
- Flash mobs emerged in the early 2000’s, initially as a form of social experiment and entertainment. They quickly evolved into a powerful tool for expression, celebration, and social commentary.
- Flash mobs are used to celebrate special occasions, promote events, and create memorable experiences. They can also be a form of social activism, raising awareness about important issues and sparking conversations. They foster a feeling of community and togetherness.
- Flash mobs can capture public attention and generate widespread media coverage. They can create a sense of surprise, joy, and connection in public spaces. They empower individuals to take part in a collective, creative action.
- *Connection to GG 11:* Today, we’re going to explore how we can use the energy and creativity of flash mob to address a critical global issue: creating sustainable cities and communities.

Show a short, compelling flash mob video that showcases a positive message or community engagement.

Introduce or re-introduce UN Global Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communties.

Divide students into small groups. Assign ech group one or two specific targets from goal 11.
Each group researches their assigned targets and indicators, focusing on:

- The current state of their target in their local community.
- Potential solutions and improvements.
- How these issues affect their daily lives and the lives of others.

*Example:* Group assigned target 11.2 researches local bus routes, bike lanes, and accessibility for people with disabilities. They find that bus routes are infrequent, and bike lanes are unsafe.

Next, present or select a song that resonates with the themes of sustainable cities and communities (depending on the class, time constraints, etc. the students can choose, or the educator can). 
Consider songs with positive, uplifting melodies and lyrics that evoke feelings of unity, environmental awareness, or social change. Example song considerations:

- “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves
- “Where is the Love” by The Black Eyed Peas

**Creative Brainstorming and Movement Design**

Once a song has been chosen, each group will brainstorm a flash mob concept that visually and symbolically represents their assigned target and its solutions.

Encourage students to use creative movement, gestures, and spatial arrangements to convey their message.

Examples:

- **Target 11.1** *(Affordable Housing)*
  - Students could create a sequence that starts with cramped, restricted movements to represent inadequate housing, then transitions to more open, expansive movements to sybolize upgraded, spacious homes.
- **Target 11.2** *(Sustainable Transportation)*
  - Students could create a movement sequence that mimics the flow of a bus, the pedaling of bicycles, or the movement of a wheelchair. They could incorporate movements that show the ease of access to public transportation.
- **Target 11.3** *(Inclusive Urbanization)*
  - Students could start with individual, isolated movements, then gradually come together in synchronized, collaborative movements. They could also have movements that show the building of a city, with everyone having a role.
- **Target 11.4** *(Cultural Heritage)*
  - Students could mimic the movements of nature (flowing water, swaying trees) or perform traditional cultural dances. They could use movements that show the protection of something precious.
- **Target 11.5** *(Disaster Resilience)*
  - Students could perform movements that show chaos and disruption (shaking, swaying), followed by movements of strength and rebuilding (lifting, supporting).
- **Target 11.6** *(Environmental Impact)*
  - Students could use movements that show the sorting of trash, the reduction of single-use plastics, and the composting of organic materials.
- **Target 11.7** *(Green Spaces)*
  - Students could use movements that simulate the growth of plants, the spreading of seeds, and the creation of community gardens. They could also make movements that show people enjoying a park.
- **Target 11.a** *(Urban-Rural Links)*
  - Students could create movements that show the exchange of goods and ideas between urban and rural areas (passing objects, connecting formations).
- **Target 11.b** *(Disaster Risk Reduction)*
  - Similar to 11.5, but with a focus on preparedness and prevention (building structures, practicing safety drills).
- **Target 11.c** *(Sustainable Buildings in Least Developed Countries)*
  - Students could use movements that show the construction of buildings with sustainable materials (stacking, weaving).

Each group will design a short movement sequence with a time limit (30 seconds, four 8 counts, etc.) that can be easily learned and performed in a public space.

**Flash Mob Rehearsal and Refinement**

Each group takes 1-2 minutes to clearly demonstrate their choreographed sequence to the rest of the class.

They should perform their sequence multiple times, slowly and clearly, so everyone can see the movements and timing.
They should explain the symbolism behind the movements and how they relate to their assigned target.

The educator should then decide the order of each groups sequence, so the class can practice the full flash mob from beginning to end, focusing on the transition between each group’s segment.

Conduct multiple full run-throughs of the flash mob, both without and with the music.
Encourage students to perform with energy and enthusiasm.
Give positive feedback after each run through.
Continue to refine the performance.

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How effectively did our flash mob, through its movements and symbolism, convey messages about sustainable cities and communities?
- What do you think was the most impactful part of our flash mob for an audience, and why?
- How did working together to create and perform this flash mob feel? Did it highlight the power of collective action?
- What challenges did you face in translating abstract ideas about sustainable cities into specific movements, and how did you overcome them?
- How does a flash mob, as a public and surprising form of performance, compare to other ways of communicating about social issues?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 11 and the importance of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable through this activity?
- How did focusing on a specific theme/target of Global Goal 11 (like transportation, waste, or green spaces) help you understand the broader challenges of urban sustainability?
- Did the process of creating the flash mob make you think differently about your own city or community and its sustainability?
- What did you learn about the interconnectedness of different aspects of urban life when choreographing and performing the entire sequence?
- How does thinking about specifics within Global Goal 11 like participation in urban planning (11.3.2) or access to public spaces (11.7.`) relate to the experience of a flash mob?
- Did participating in the flash mob make you feel more connected to the idea of civic engagement and participatory action?
- What emotions did you experience during the creative and rehearsal process, and how do those emotions connect to the importance of urban sustainability?
- What is one key takeaway about sustainable cities and the role of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including brainstorming, movement design, group rehearsals, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 11, targets and core concept, as demonstrated through the symbolism and intention within the movement sequences and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in designing movements that visually and symbolically represent aspects of sustainable cities. Look for innovative and clear communication through physical expression.
- How clearly and powerfully the group’s movement sequence communicated its intended message about Global Goal 11. Did the movements successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the goal?
- Ability to work effectively within the group(s), contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively during choreography and rehearsal.
- Dedication to practicing and refining the flash mob sequence(s), demonstrating an understanding of timing, synchronization, and spatial awareness to create a cohesive whole.
- Nuance and insight demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of performance art in advocating for sustainable development and the complexities of urban challenges.

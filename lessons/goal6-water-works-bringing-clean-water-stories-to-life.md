**Introduction**

Welcome students to an exciting drama class. Explain that they will use their voices and imagination to explore a very important idea today: Global Goal 6, Clean Water and Sanitation.

Clarify that Global Goal 6 means everyone, everywhere, has access to clean water for drinking, washing, and playing, and safe ways to keep our environments clean (like good restrooms and trash disposal). Emphasize that this means healthy rivers, lakes, and oceans, and clean hands for all!

Show a brief, impactful video clip that highlights an aspect of water.

Examples (decide what is appropriate for your class and students):

- The beauty of pristine water environments.
  - [Planet Earth II - Islands: The Great Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkhGT997hjs)
  - [Crystal Clear Blue Waters At Crater Lake National Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_9D3LeKlsg)
  - [Most Beautiful Waterfalls on Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIiri4wePAY)
- The stark reality of water scarcity or pollution.
  - [Pollution Endangers Bangladesh's Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYRopQIotE)
  - [Water Doesn't Come from a Tap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDPkFykvZjc)
  - [Mexico City residents struggle with worsening water crisis](https://www.pbs.org/video/water-crisis-1709500629/)
- A success story of a community gaining access to clean water/sanitation.
  - [Plateau state gets a solar-driven motorized water facility and WASH facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVjwIaik3qg)
  - [Young African Girl Finally Gets Clean Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQCsUDyGfP0)
  - [Water is Life: Rural Empowerment Success Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfhgkRPXUqU)

Open a discussion with students, asking guiding questions like:

- What did you see and feel when watching that video clip about water?
- Beyond just drinking, why do you think clean water is super important for our daily lives, for animals, plants, and the environment?
- Can you imagine a day when water wasn't easy to get, maybe at home or when you were camping? What would that be like?
- What do you think is important about keeping places clean, like our restrooms at school, or keeping trash out of rivers?

Introduce the class to the drama style of Readers Theater. Explain that Readers Theater is a special way to perform a story using only voices and facial expressions to bring characters to life. Clarify that actors usually stand up, often hold their scripts, and focus on using their vocal tone, volume, facial expressions, and speed to show feelings and make the audience imagine the scene. Tell students that today, they will all become voice actors, bringing water stories to life.

**Warm Up: Voice Mixer, Water Sounds**

Explain that to prepare for this expressive reading, the class will explore different sounds of water using their voices. Have them stand comfortably and listen carefully.

*Dripping Sounds*

- Say: Let's start with a tiny, gentle sound, like a single water drop. On the count of three, we'll all make a tiny "drip" sound with our voices. 1, 2, 3…drip
  - Guide students to make soft, precise vocal sounds.
- Say: Now, let's make it a little faster, like many drips
  - Guide students to make faster, staccato dripping sounds.

*Flowing Stream*

- Say: Now, imagine a stream. We'll make soft, continuous "shhh" or "zzzz" sounds, like water flowing smoothly. Let your voice be calm and even.
  - Guide students to make sustained, flowing vocalizations.

*Rushing River*

- Say: The stream is becoming a rushing river. Make your "shhh" sound louder and more powerful, like a strong current.
  - Guide students to increase vocal volume and intensity.

*Bubbling and Gurgling*

- Now, let's make bubbling and gurgling sounds, like water in a fountain or drain. Use your voice to make bubbly noises.
  - Guide students to make vocal bubbling noises.

*Happy Splashing*

- Let's make happy splashing sounds. Use your voice to make cheerful "splash" or "whoosh" sounds, showing the joy of clean water.
  - Guide students to make quick, joyful vocal sounds.

Conclude the warm up by affirming students' vocal range, creativity, and openness.

**Our Water Works Performances**

Explain the selected Readers Theater scripts are all about Global Goal 6. Distribute the copies of scripts to each student. Instruct them to find the other students who will be reading the same script, and rearrange seating within the class. 

[Example Scripts.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N-BSX347mOPid-W34_b5ZqSNPvWqISRw?usp=drive_link)(Note: The given scripts have parts for 6-10 students. A student can take more than one part to make the number work).

Instruct students to quickly look at their script, identify their character, and find their highlighted lines. Encourage them to quickly read through their assigned part silently, getting familiar with their character's lines.

**Character Voice and Feeling Web Brainstorm**

Explain that the class will create a character voice and feeling web to help bring their characters to life. They will brainstorm who their character is and how their voice sounds based on their feelings in the story.

Make sure all students have paper and a pen/pencil.

On the board/paper, draw a central circle. Write "My Readers Theater Character" inside the circle.

Draw several branches coming from the center, labeled: "My Character's Name and Role," "How My Character Feels," "How My Character Sounds," and "What My Character Wants."

Instruct each student to focus on their character from the script.

Have students write down their answers and thoughts as you go through this exercise.

- *My Character's Name and Role:* Who is your character in the story? Are they a child, a parent, a community member, a river, a scientist?
- *How My Character Feels:* How does your character feel at the beginning of the story? Do they feel worried, tired, hopeful, determined, proud? How do they feel at the end?
  - Encourage students to think about changes in emotion.
- *How My Character Sounds:* Based on their feelings, how would your character's voice sound? Would it be high, low, fast, slow, loud, soft, shaky, clear, scratchy, calm, strong, joyful?
  - Prompt for specific vocal qualities.
- *What My Character Wants:* What does your character want to happen in the story? Do they want clean water, help for their community, to solve a problem, to be heard?

Have students share some of their ideas.

**Rehearsal and Performance**

Arrange chairs or create a simple performance area for the groups to utilize. Emphasize that the focus is on vocal delivery and expression, not elaborate staging.

Explain that all groups will have time to rehearse their scripts, focusing on bringing their characters to life with their voices. Encourage students to:

- *Project Voices:* Make sure your voice is loud and clear enough for everyone to hear.
- *Show Emotions with Voice:* Use your voice to show what your character is feeling. Use a worried tone, a happy speed, or a strong volume.
- *Use Facial Expressions:* Your face can show your character's emotions even without speaking loudly.
- *Listen and React:* Listen to your scene partner's lines and react with your voice and face.
- *Work Together:* Help each other remember lines or find the right voice.

Circulate, offering guidance and listening for clear vocalizations and expressive reading.

Once all groups have rehearsed, have each group perform their Readers Theater script for the class. Remind the audience to listen carefully to the voices and imagine the story.

After all groups have performed, connect the performances back to Global Goal 6, asking guiding questions like:

- Which characters or situations resonated with you the most across all the scenes? Why?
- How did the actors' voices and expressions help you understand what their characters were going through? What vocal choices stood out?
- What common challenges or obstacles related to clean water and sanitation did you notice across the different scenes? (e.g., difficulty getting clean water, sickness from dirty water, problems with trash, long distances to collect water, needing good places to wash hands).
- What solutions or positive changes were presented in the scripts? What actions were taken by the characters to make things better? (e.g., a community building a well, children learning about hand washing, people cleaning up a river, sharing water during a dry spell, inventing new ways to save water).
- Even though these were fictional stories, can you identify any real-world parallels or examples of similar challenges and solutions that you've heard about?
- How did hearing these stories through Readers Theater make you think differently about Global Goal 6?
- What feelings did the performances evoke in you about water and sanitation?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using your voices to perform Readers Theater help you understand Global Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation in a new way?
- What did you learn about the importance of clean water and why it's a big promise for everyone in the world?
- Which characters or story moments from the Readers Theater performances made you think or feel the most about clean water, and why?
- What does this activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 6?
- What's one small action you feel inspired to take this week to help keep water clean or save water?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, script reading, brainstorm, rehearsal, and class discussions. 
- Understanding of the core concept of clean water and sanitation (access, hygiene, pollution prevention), as demonstrated through the character portrayl, reading of the scene, and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in using vocal elements (tone, volume, pace) and facial expressions to bring the character and story to life. Look for clear effort in expressing emotions and concepts through voice.
- Ability to work effectively within the groups, demonstrating active listening, responsive reading, and a cohesive ensemble effort during the Readers Theater performance.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

**Introduction**

Begin with an introduction to Shakespeare.

- William Shakespeare was a renowned English playwright and poet whose works from the late 16th and early 17th centuries are still studied and performed today. His plays often explore universal themes of power, justice, cooperation, and the complexities of human relationships.
- We’ll look at short excerpts that touch upon these themes, focusing on the language and dramatic situations rather than the complex plot details.

Briefly introduce key elements of Shakespearean language.

- When we read Shakespeare, the language can sometimes seem a little different from how we speak today, but don’t let that intimidate you. Think of it like listening to a slightly older version of English, like how someone from a different generation might use some words differently than you do. The core of the stories and emotions are still very much the same.

`	`Here are a couple things you might notice:

- *Iambic Pentameter (The rhythm):* Shakespeare often wrote his plays in a rhythm called iambic pentameter. It might sound a bit technical, but it just means that many of the lines have a kind of heartbeat rhythm to them. Imagine saying “ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM.” There are ten syllables in the line, alternating between a softer and a stronger beat. This rhythm gives the language a kind of musicality and flow. Don’t worry about counting every beat perfectly; just listen for that natural, almost song-like quality in some of the lines. It’s part of what makes Shakespeare sound so powerful and memorable.
- *Thee and Thou (Old pronouns):* You’ll also see some different pronouns used. Instead of “you,” Shakespear often used “thee” and “thou.” Think of it simply as another way of saying “you.” Sometimes, “thou” was used when speaking to someone familiar or of lower status, and “thee” was often used as the object of a verb (like “I see thee”). It’s not essential to know all the grammatical rules right now; just understand when you see “thee” or “thou,” it generally means “you.”
- *Other Words or Phrases:* You might encounter some words that aren’t common today, or phrases that sound a little old-fashioned. Don’t get bogged down trying to understand every single word perfectly. Often, you can get the general idea from the context of the sentence and the emotions the characters are expressing.

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 17: strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Emphasize the need for collaboration across nations and sectors.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 17: strengthening domestic resources, official development assistance, mobilizing financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, trade, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Connect Global Goal 17 and Shakespeare.

- While Shakespeare didn’t write about the UN or sustainable development as we know it today, his plays often depict the dynamics of power, trade, alliances, and the responsibilities of leaders, which resonate with the principles of global partnership.
- We’ll explore how the relationships and dialogues in these excerpts can illuminate the importance of cooperation, shared resources, and mutual support - the very essence of global Goal 17.

**Collaborative Shakespearan Scene Work**

Choose one or multiple (based on time and bandwidth) Shakespeare scene excerpts for students to read/act out in front of the class. Students can be chosen or can volunteer.

Provide students with the chosen script excerpts. [EXAMPLES](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dyROf4iOQDA29k-5qB3idfSJoJcEp4sC?usp=drive_link).

- Students can read the original excerpt, modern translation, or both, depending on what will serve the classroom and lesson best.

The class will (with guidance):

- Identify the characters involved and their relationships.
- Discuss the situation in the excerpt; What are they trying to achieve? Is their cooperation or conflict? How might this relate to a specific target or idea surrounding Global Goal 17?

Guide students in a “table read” or simple staging/delivery.

Encourage clear and expressive reading, focusing on conveying the emotion and intent behind the words.

Ensure students know the main focus is to try and grasp the overall meaning of what the characters are saying and the emotions they are feeling.

Have students pay attention to:

- *The Situation:* What’s happening in the scene? What do the characters want?
- *The Tone of Voice:* Do they sound angry, sad, hopeful, determined? Even if every word is not understood completely, how a character feels can be understood.
- *The Relationships:* How do the characters interact with each other? Are they allies, enemies, or trying to make a deal?

**Group Sharing and Connection**

After excerpt(s) are read/performed, facilitate a short discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- What was the core intention or goal in this scene?
- How might the relationship or exchange between these characters relate to the idea of global partnership?
- Can you connect any of the themes or actions in the excerpt to a specific target or idea of Global Goal 17?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did exploring Shakespearean text - even with its older language - help you connect with the fundamental ideas of collaboration, aid, and trade that are central to Global Goal 17?
- What did you learn about human relationships and power dynamics as depicted in Shakespeare that resonates with the challenges and opportunities of modern global partnerships?
- Did seeing these historical interactions acted out (or read aloud) make the abstract concepts of international cooperation feel more tangible or relatable?
- How does Shakespeare’s portrayal of alliances, conflicts, or negotiations offer insights into the “art of partnership”?
- What surprises did you find in connecting an early modern play to a contemporary global goal?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 17 and the importance of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development through this lesson?
- How did the specific themes or conflicts in the Shakespearean excerpts you explored highlight different facets or challenges related to Global Goal 17 (e.g., financial resources, technology transfer, trade, global governance)?
- Did the activity make you think differently about the responsibilities of leaders and nations in fostering collaboration?
- What common elements of successful (or unsuccessful) partnerships did you observe in the Shakespearean scenes that apply to real-world efforts to achieve the Global Goals?
- How does understanding the enduring nature of human interaction (as seen in Shakespeare) inform our approach to building lasting global partnerships today?
- Did any particular line, character, or dramatic moment from the Shakespearean excerpts resonate with you personally regarding the importance of working together?
- What emotions or motivations did you experience during this lesson, and how might they inspire you to take action related to Global Goal 17?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in fostering cooperation in your daily life or community, even if it’s not on a “global stage”?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Shakespeare, script exploration, reading/acting out scenes, and active participation in class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., resource mobilization, technology transfer, trade, international cooperation) as demonstrated through the interpretation of the Shakespearean excerpts’ themes and the verbal explanations. 
- Ability to read/act out the chosen Shakespearean lines with clarity, appropriate tone, and emotional expression (whether reading the original or modern version), effectively conveying character intent despite the older language.
- Skill in articulating clear and thoughtful connections between the relationships and situations depicted in Shakespeare’s plays and the principles and challenges of Global Goal 17.
- Ability to work effectively together, demonstrating active listening, responsive acting, and a collective effort to bring the scene to life (if group performance).
- Ability to briefly identify how Shakespearean elements (e.g., character relationships, power dynamics, dialogue structure) contribute to the scene’s message about partnership (if applicable).
- Nuance and insight demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning how theater and literature can illuminate global challenges and the complexities of building effective partnerships.

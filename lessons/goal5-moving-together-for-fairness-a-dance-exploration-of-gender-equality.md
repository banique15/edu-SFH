**Introduction**

Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement lesson. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 5, Gender Equality, which aims to make sure everyone, boys, girls, men, and women, have fair and equal chances in life. Emphasize that this means everyone gets to be treated with respect, has the same opportunities to learn and grow, and can feel strong and proud of who they are, no matter their gender. You explain that it’s all about being fair to all!

Explain to students that sometimes, the best way to understand big ideas, like making things fair and equal for everyone, is to show them with our bodies. Clarify that dance and movement are powerful ways to show feelings, problems, and amazing solutions without needing many or any words.

Tell students that today, the class will explore what fairness and equality feels like, how challenges might try to block us, and how we can move together to create a world where everyone is treated with respect and has equal opportunities.

**Warm Up: Reflecting Respect**

Instruct students to pair up (or assign pairs) and face each other, ensuring enough space for movement between each pair.

Explain the concept of mirroring: one person (leader) initiates movements, and the other person (follower) reflects them as accurately and smoothly as possible, like a mirror. You can demonstrate a brief example with a student or colleague if helpful.

Emphasize the importance of focus, observation, and nonverbal communication. Instruct students to pay close attention to their partner’s movements and try to understand their non-verbal cues.

[Optional] Calm, focused music for mirroring activity .

Examples:

	[“Gymnopédie No. 1” by Erik Satie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU)

	[“Clair de Lune” by Claude Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGJPVl7iQUM)

	[“Nuvole Bianche” by Ludovico Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR2W2scFS4Y)

	[“Weightless” by Marconi Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU)

	[“River Flows in You” by Yiruma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiBvOKmuWKg)

Upbeat, empowering music for main activity.

Examples:

	[“Oogway Ascends” by Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAVnGvRwXew)

	[“Hedwig’s Theme” by John Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtHra9tFISY)

	[“Spirit of Adventure” by Michael Giacchino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN5DKM72O_s)

	[“He’s a Pirate” by Klaus Badelt/Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuYf0taXoNw)

	[“Fanfare for the Common Man” by Aaron Copland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NjssV8UuVA)

Encourage the leaders to start with simple, slow, and deliberate movements, gradually increasing complexity as they gain confidence. Suggest exploring different parts of the body (head, arms, torso, legs, facial expressions) and movement qualities (smooth, sharp, flowing, sustained).

Encourage leaders to infuse their movements with emotions (e.g., a “happy” movement, a “strong” movement, a “calm” movement), and followers try and capture those emotions in their mirroring.

After a few minutes, instruct partners to switch roles, allowing everyone to experience both leading and following. Encourage students to observe how their experience changes when they switch roles.

Open a brief discussion about the experience. Ask guiding questions like:

- How did it feel to lead? What did you try to communicate with your movements?
- How did it feel to follow? What cues did you pay attention to to understand your partner?
- Did you feel a sense of connection with your partner during the mirroring? How did it feel to try and understand and express their movements and emotions without words?
- What were some of the challenges you faced in mirroring? What moments felt particularly successful or rewarding?

Transition to Global Goal 5 by explaining how this mirroring exercise relates to understanding and emphathizing with others, listening carefully, and responding with respect; all crucial aspects of achieving fairness and equality for everyone.

**Our Dance for Fairness**

Explain that the class will create a vocabulary for fairness. Tell students that they will think about words connected to fairness and unfairness, and then brainstorm how their bodies can show those ideas and feelings.

Divide the board/paper into two colums: Unfair (Challenges) and Fair & Equal (Solutions and Strength).

- *Unfair (Challenges)*
  - Ask: What words or movements come to mind when things are unfair or unequal? How would your body show feeling left out, or not being heard, or facing a challenge because of unfairness?

    Examples:

    - *Left Out:* Curling inward, turning away, slow heavy steps, a small quiet gesture, looking down, a slumped posture.
    - *Blocked/Stopped:* Pushing against an invisible wall, stiff jerky movements, shaking head, arms crossed tightly, a sudden stop.
    - *Not Heard:* Miming covering ears, small weak gestures, a silent shout, trying to speak but nothing comes out, looking confused or sad.
    - *Weak/Small:* Crouching low, trembling slow tired movements, trying to stand tall but falling or losing balance, a hesitant step.
    - *Unequal:* One side of the body higher than the other, unbalanced poses, a wobbly movement, trying to share but one person gets more.
- Write these words and movement ideas under Unfair (Challenges).

*Fair and Equal (Solutions and Strength)*

- Ask: What words or movements come to mind when things are fair and equal, when everyone feels strong and respected? How would your body show being included, or being heard, or working together fairly?

Examples:

- *Included/Together:* Open arms, reaching out, joining hands (if appropriate), moving in a circle, a big expansive gesture, a welcoming smile, moving side-by-side.
- *Strong/Brave:* Standing tall, chest out, firm steps, powerful arm movements, a determined gaze, a confident stride.
- *Heard/Voice:* Open mouth gestures, head held high, clear strong movements, reaching out to others, a confident nod.
- *Equal/Balanced:* Even movements, symmetrical poses, two people mirroring each other, a steady flowing motion, hands outstretched evenly.
- *Helping/Supporting:* One person lifting another (symbolically), gentle guiding hands, a shared weight, a supportive pat on the back, a high-five, a group huddle.
- Write these words and brief movement ideas under Fair and Equal (Solutions and Strength).

Summarize that this movement vocabulary gives us a lot of ideas for our dance today!

**The Fairness Flow: Dance Course**

Use cones or markers, etc. to create a simple, open dance obstacle course (this can be done before the class begins, or any time during the lesson). The “obstacles” should be symbolic and allow for creative movement and expression, not literal barriers.

Create 3-4 “stations” throughout the room.

- *Station 1: The Blocked Path Dance (Unfairness)*

  Example*:

  - A line of cones or tape across the floor that students must find a creative way to “move through” or “overcome” without stepping directly on them (e.g., a low crawl, a high jump, a zig-zag, a creative sidestep). This represents unfair rules or discrimination.
- *Station 2: The Uneven Ground Dance (Inequality)*

  Example:

  - A small area marked by tape/hula hoop/etc. where students must move in a way that feels unbalanced or difficult (e.g., walking on tiptoes, taking very small steps, only walking on heels, swaying side to side). This represents unequal opportunities.
- *Station 3: The Silent Circle Dance (Not Being Heard)*

  Example:

  - A small circle marked on the floor where students must enter and try to express a feeling or idea silently with their body and face, then try to “break out” to be heard (e.g., miming speaking but no sound, big gestures, a strong, determined movement to exit). This represents feeling silenced.
- *Station 4: The Teamwork Bridge Dance (Collaboration)*

  Examples:

  - Two parallel linies of tape on the floor, about 2-3 feet apart. Students must move from one side to the other, showing teamwork (e.g., moving in sync with a partner, helping a teammate across with a supportive gesture, creating a “human bridge” with their bodies if appropriate and safe). This represents collective action.

*Game Play*

Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students per group).

Explain the game: Each group will rotat through the dance stations. At each station, they will spend about 2-3 minutes.

One person from each group will navigate through the station using with, using movements from the Movement Vocabulary brainstorm to show the challenge and then how they overcome it.

The rest of the group will act as “supporters” and “encouragers,” offering non-verbal encouragement (e.g., clapping, nodding, mirroring supportive movements, can get involved if the station and movement allows for it).

Emphasize that there or no right or wrong answers, and encourage creativity and expression in movement. Remind students to think about the feelings and ideas they are showing.

Continue until the whole group has navigated the course.

[Optional] Play upbeat, empowering music.

[Optional Variation] Trust Walk

At one of the stations (e.g., the “safest” one marked with tape, clear path) have the students work in pairs. One person is blindfolded (or closes their eyes), representing the vulnerability faced by those who lack opportunities or trust. Their partner must verbally guid ethem through simple dance movements along the path (e.g., step forward, sway your arms like branches, take two little hopping steps to the right). Emphasize the importance of trust, clear communication, and responsibility. After a minute, partners switch roles, until the whole group has completed the course (if an odd number, than one member of the group will guide twice).

Open a brief discussion after this variation with guiding questions like:

- How did it feel to be blindfolded and rely on someone else to guide your dance?
- How did it feel to use only your voice to guide someone’s movement?
- How does this relate to the importance of trust, clear support, and allyship in achieving gender equality?

**Group Sharing: Movement Stories of Fairness**

After the class has finished all the stations, gather all students together. Invite each group to choose one station or moment from their dance course experience that felt most powerful or clearly showed a challenge or solution related to fairness.

Instruct each group to briefly re-create that movement or short dance sequence of movements for the class. They should focus on the expressive quality of their dance.

After each group performs, invite the audience to share. Ask guiding questions like:

- What challenge or feeling did you see them showing in their movement?
- What solution or positive action did you see them doing?
- How did their movements show us somethin about fairness or equality?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using our bodies to move and create scenes help you understand Global Goal 5: Gender Equality in a new way?
- What did you learn about the importance of fairness, respect, and equal chances for everyone, no matter their gender?
- Which movements or ideas from our activities made you think or feel the most about fairness, and why?
- What does this activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 5?
- What’s one small, active thing you feel inspired to do this week to promote fairness and respect in your school or home?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, movement game, and class discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of gender equality (fairness, equal opportunities, respect for all genders), as demonstrated through the movement choices, navigation of the obstacle course, and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in using their bodies to convey emotions and ideas related to both the challenges and solutions for fairness. Look for clear effort in expressing the feeling and concept through movement.
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups during the obstacle course, offering verbal encouragement, brainstorming movement solutions, and demonstrating effective teamwork (especially during the Trust walk variation, if implemented).
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

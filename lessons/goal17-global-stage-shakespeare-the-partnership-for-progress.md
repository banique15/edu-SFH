## Global Stage: Shakespeare & The Partnership For Progress

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Open space suitable for movement and group work

Scripts (short excerpts from Shakespearean plays connected to themes of Global Goal 17)

Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper
Pens/pencils

[Optional] Simple props: A crown for royalty, a map for trade routes, two chairs facing each other for dialogue, etc.

**Introduction**

`	`Begin by introducing William Shakespeare. Explain that he was a famous writer from a long timea go, and his stories are still told today because they are about things that everyone can understand and relate to, like friendship, conflict, and love.

`	`Explain that the class will be reading a simplified version of one of his plays, and also watching a performance of the same excerpt. The language from the excerpt might sound a little different, the context and feeling of the characters can help to figure out what is happening.

`	`Review some of the things students will hear in the video excerpt/original Shakespearean version:

- *Iambic Pentameter (The Rhythm):* Explain that Shakespeare’s plays often have a fun, musical rhythm to them. Tell students to imagine a heartbeat rhythm: ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM, ba-DUM. This rhythm gives the words a certain feel, and listening for it can help to understand the flow of the story.
- *Thee and Thou (Old Pronouns):* Explain that in Shakespeare’s time, people used different words for “you.” When students see or hear “thee” or “thou,” they can just think of it as meaning “you.”

`	`Next, introduce UN Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships-the idea that people and countries need to work together to solve big problems. We’ll see how Shakespear’s stories about kings, queen,s and friends working together are really just examples of partnerships in action through drama.

**Watching and Reading Our Scene**

`	`Choose one excerpt from a scene that highlights a theme of partnership, such as two characters forming an alliance, or two groups trying to negotiate a fair trade.

`	`Examples:

- [Julius Caesar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjG_Huf7tZw), Act 2 Scene 1 (beginning at 27:58)
- [Julius Caesar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjG_Huf7tZw), Act 4 Scene 3 (beginning at 1:20:06)
- [The Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcnp8apSJ1k), Act 2 Scene 2 (beginning at 42:50)
- [Romeo and Juliet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HbvBVhpChI), Act 4 Scene 3

`	`*Watch:* Play a short video clip of a professional performance of the chosen scene. Afterward, discuss what students observed, by asking guiding questions like:

- What did you notice about the actors’ body language? How did their movements show if they were working together or against each other?
- How did the tone of their voices change throughout the scene? When did their voices sound stronga nd confident, and whend id they sound worried or unsure?
- Did the characters seem to trust each other? What made you think that?
- How did the actors’ performance help you understand the story, even if some of the language was a bit tricky?

`	`*Read:* Distribute the simplified script and assign roles to different students. Be flexible and creative in assigning roles (if the excerpt only have two roles, each student can have a turn, or only two students can play the roles, etc.).

The class will read the scene together out loud, with each student reading their assigned part. After reading, lead a whole class discussion with guiding questions like:

- Who are the characters in this scene? What do they want?
- What kind of partnership is happening here? Is it a good one? Why or why not?
- How does this scene show that teamwork and compromise are important?

**Connection to Global Goal 17**

`	`Lead a whole class discussion, connecting the historical story of Shakespeare to the modern-day goal of global partnership. Write down student ideas on the whiteboard/paper.

`	`Ask guiding questions to open the conversation, like:

- How does the partnership in our scene remind you of a partnership in your own life?
- What did you learn about the importance of listening to others in a partnership from this scene?
- How can we connect the partnership in our scene to the idea of countries working together to solve a big problem, which is what Global Goal 17 is all about?

`	`*Creative Response:* Ask students to imagine the characters in the scene working to achieve Global Goal 17. Have them imagine what kind of partnerships they would form? Discuss in the class.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did reading a play from a long time ago help you understand the importance of partnerships today? Did it feel different from reading a news article about it?
- What did you learn about the importance of listening to others, even when their words are different from your own? How is that like being a part of a partnership?
- What did you learn about the power of drama to help us understand a big idea and to inspire us to take action?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Shakespeare, the reading of the scene, and active participation in class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., resource mobilization, technology transfer, trade, international cooperation) as demonstrated through the interpretation of the Shakespearean excerpts and the verbal explanations.
- Ability to read and act out the chosen lines with clarity, appropriate tone, and emotional expression, effectively conveying character intent despite the older language.
- Skill in articulating clear and thoughtful connections between the relationships and situations depicted in Shakespeare’s plays and the principles and challenges of Global Goal 17.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening and the ability to articulate what was observed and learned from the collective performance.

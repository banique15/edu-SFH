**Introduction**

Begin with a clear and engaging explanation of mime.

Mime is a form of theater that uses movement and gesture to tell stories and express ideas without words. It relies on physical precision, clarity of action, and the ability to create illusions.

Demonstrate basic mime techniques:

- *Isolation:* Moving only one part of the body (e.g., hand, head).
- *Resistance:* Creating the illusion of pushing or pulling against an invisible object.
- *Weight and size:* Using movement to show the weight or size of an object.
- *Facial expressions:* Conveying emotions without words.

Have students briefly practice these techniques.

Introduce or reintroduce Un Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the importance of the oceans for life on Earth and the urgency of protecting them. 

Provide a holistic overview of the challenges and importance of ocean conservation.

- Emphasize interconnectedness:
  - The ocean isn’t just a big body of water; it’s a giant, interconnected system that affects all life on Earth, including us.
  - Think of it as the planet’s life support system.
- Highlight key functions:
  - *Oxygen Production:* Did you know that the ocean produces a huge portion of the oxygen we breathe? Tiny plankton are responsible for this.
  - *Climate Regulation:* The ocean absorbs a lot of the heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to regulate our climate.
  - *Biodiversity Hotspot:* It’s home to an incredible diversity of life, from microscopic organisms to giant whales.
  - *Food and Livelihoods:* Billions of people rely on the ocean for food and their jobs, especially in coastal communities.
- If wanted, show images or short clips of:
  - A variety of marine life (coral reefs, fish, marine mammals, etc.)
    - Youtube: “Coral reef” or “Marine biodiversity”
    - Image Search: “Coral reef ecosystem,” “Deep sea creatures,” “Marine mammals”
    - NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) NOAA has excellent photos and videos of marine life.
  - Ocean currents and ecosystems.
    - Youtube: “Ocean currents visualization,” “Great Barrier Reef ecosystem,” “Deep ocean exploration”
    - Image Search: “Ocean currents map,” “Marine food web,” “Hydrothermal vents”
    - NASA: NASA has satellite imagery and visualizations of ocean currents.
  - Coastal communities and fishing boats.
    - YouTube: “Fishing in ______ [specific coastal region],” “Coastal village life,” “Sustainable fishing practices”
    - Image Search: “Fishing boats harbor,” “Coastal fishing village,” “Aquaculture farm”
- Overarching Issues
  - Unfortunately, this vital system is under threat. Human activities are putting enormous pressure on the ocean.

Connect to Global Goal 14

- *Pollution:*
  - We dump vast amounts of waste into the ocean, especially plastic. This harms marine animals and pollutes ecosystems. (Target 14.1)
    - Media
- *Overfishing:*
  - We’re taking fish out of the ocean faster than they can reproduce, disrupting the delicate balance of the food web. (Target 14.4)
    - Media
- *Climate Change Impacts*
  - The ocean is also being affected by climate change, becoming warmer and more acidic. (Target 14.3)
    - Media
- *Habitat Destruction*
  - We’re destroying important habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds, which are essential for many marine species. (Targets 14.2 and 14.5)
    - Media

Highlight the Consequences

- These problems are not just about harming animals; they threaten the entire ocean ecosystem and our own wellbeing.
- If we don’t take action, we could lose many marine species, disrupt food supplies, and face coastal flooding and other disasters.
- That’s why Global Goal 14 is so important. It’s a call for us to protect the ocean and use its resources sustainably.
- It’s about finding ways to live in balance with the ocean, so it can continue to support life on Earth.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What images come to mind when you think of  the ocean?
- What are some of the ways humans interact with the ocean?
- What are some of the biggest threats to marine life?

Connect mime and Global Goal 14 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how mime can be used to explore themes related to the ocean. 

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use mime to represent the movement of ocean currents or the behavior of marine animals?
- Can we show the impact of pollution or overfishing through mime?
- How can mime convey the emotions we feel about the ocean?

**Guided Mime Exploration: Ocean Scenes**

Lead the entire class through a series of mime exercises, each focusing on a specific aspect of Global Goal 14.

Emphasize clear instructions, physical precision, and creative interpretation.

Examples of Mime Sequences:

- *Ocean Currents*
  - Let’s begin by exploring the movement of ocean currents. Imagine you are a current, flowing through the water. Start with small, gentle movements, like a ripple. Gradually expand your movements, becoming a powerful current. Show the different ways water moves - swirling, surging, flowing smoothly.
  - *Focus:* Flowing movements, changes in intensity, spatial awareness.
- *Marine Life*
  - Now, let’s explore different forms of marine life. Imagine you are a jellyfish, pulsing gently through the water. Move with slow, graceful motions. Now, imagine you are a fast-moving fish, darting and changing direction quickly. Now, imagine you are a whale, moving with immense power and slow, deep breaths.
  - *Focus:* Different animal movements, use of levels (high, medium, low), body shapes.
- *The Impact of Pollution*
  - Imagine plastic waste entering the ocean. Start with flowing, open movements, then gradually constrict your movements, showing the entanglement and restriction caused by plastic. Show the struggle of marine life to move freely.
  - *Focus:* Contrasting movements, use of resistance, facial expressions of distress.
- *Overfishing*
  - Imagine a school of fish swimming together. Move in a group, showing their unity and energy. Now, imagine a net capturing them. Show the confusion, panic, and loss of freedom. Show the emptiness left behind.
  - *Focus:* Group dynamics, use of space, conveying a sense of loss.
- *Ocean’s Resilience*
  - Imagine the power of a wave, crashing and reforming. Show the energy and renewal of the ocean. Use strong, expansive movements.
  - *Focus:* Strong, dynamic movements, use of force and energy.

Throughout the exercises:

- Provide clear instructions and demonstrations.
- Encourage students to explore and interpret the imagery in their own way.
- Emphasize physical precision and clarity of action.
- Create a safe and supportive environment for experimentation.

**Creative Mime Exploration**

After the guided sequences, facilitate a period of free mime exploration.

Invite students to:

- Reflect on the images and sensations experienced during the guided mime.
- Explore their own mime responses to the themes of the ocean and its challenges.
- Create short mime scenes or vignettes that express their understanding of Global Goal 14.

Provide prompts or suggestions. Examples:

- Show the journey of a piece of plastic from land to the ocean.
- Mime the actions of a scientist studying marine life.
- Create a mime that represents the interconnectedness of all life in the ocean.

**Cool Down and Discussion**

Lead a gentle cool down to change the energy and prepare for reflection.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What was your experience with the mime exploration?
- Which mime movements or sequences were most powerful for you?
- How did the absence of words affect your understanding of the issues?
- What did you learn about your own capacity for physical expression and storytelling?
- How can mime be a tool for raising awareness and inspiring action?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using mime - communicating solely through movement and gesture - help you to understand and express ideas about ocean conservation and the challenges faced by life below water?
- What did you learn about the power of physical precision and clarity of action in conveying complex messages about marine pollution, biodiversity, or overfishing?
- Did the absence of words in the exploration make you feel a deeper, more visceral connection to the issues? Why or why not?
- What did you discover about your own capacity for nonverbal storytelling and empathy through the mime exercises?
- How can mime, as a silent art form, effectively capture the beauty, fragility, or urgency of the ocean’s story?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 14 and the importance of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources through this mime exploration?
- How did the different mime sequences (e.g., ocean currents, marine life, impact of pollution) illuminate the diverse aspects of ocean health that Global Goal 14 addresses?
- Did the activity make you think differently about the interconnectedness of marine ecosystems and how human actions impact them?
- How does a holistic understanding of ocean conservation, as explored through mime, relate to the broader goals of a sustainable future?
- Did any particular movement or sequence resonate with you on a personal level, perhaps sparking a new commitment to ocean conservation?
- What emotions did you connect with during this mime activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 14?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in protecting life below water in your daily life or community?

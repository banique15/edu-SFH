Drawing paper; several sheets per student (standard printer paper or larger)

Pencils, pens, markers, colored pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

Pens/Pencils


**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to the “cadavre exquis” or “exquisite corpse” art activity.

Explain that exquisite corpose is a collaborative drawing game invented by the Surrealists. The name comes from a phrase created in one of the first drawings: “Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau” (The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).

The game involves multiple people drawing sections of a composition or figure on folded paper, without knowing what the previous person has drawn. The result is often surprising, illogical, and visually interesting.

This game will be adapted to explore complex ideas connected to Global Goal 16, in a creative way.

Demonstrate the process:

- Fold a piece of paper into three (or more) sections.
- The first person draws in the top section, then folds the paper so their drawing is hidden (or follows the pre-made fold), leaving only a small part of their lines visible for the next person.
- The second person draws in the next section, using the visible lines as a starting point, and then folds their section.
- The process continues for each student.
- Unfold the final result to reveal the “exquisite corpse.”

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Emphasize the broad scope of this goal and its relevance to individual lives and global communities.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:

- Reducing violence and promoting safety.
- Ending abuse and exploitation.
- Ensuring justice and the rule of law.
- Building effective and inclusive institutions.
- Promoting participation and access to information.

Connect the activity and Global Goal 16 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how the exquisite corpse activity can connect to the themes of Global Goal 16.

Examples of guiding questions:

- How can the unexpected combinations in exquisite corpse drawings reflect the complexities and interconnectedness of issues related to peace and justice?
- Can the different sections drawn by individuals represent different perspectives or aspects of a societal challenge?
- How might the collaborative nature of the game symbolize the need for collective action in achieving Global Goal 16?
- Can the sometimes illogical results spark new ways of thinking about solutions?

**Exquisite Corpose Creation: Visualizing Global Goal 16**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students per group)

Have all groups create exquisite corpse drawings that relate to Global Goal 16 as a whole, allowing for individual interpretation within the collaborative process.
OR
Assign each small group a specific aspect of Global Goal 16 to visualize through their exquisite corpse drawing (e.g., one group focuses on violence reduction, another on access to justice, etc.).

Each group follows the steps of the exquisite corpse game:

- Each student takes a piece of paper and folds it into three or four (depending on group size) horizontal sections (this step can be done beforehand, students can receive prefolded paper).
- The first student draws an image or abstract design in the top section that they feel connects to their assigned theme, or Global Goal 16 generally.
- They then fold the paper to hide their drawing, leaving only a small part of the bottom lines visible under the fold as a starting point for the next person.
- The paper is passed to the next student, who draws in the next section, incorporating the visible lines.
- This continues until everyone in the group has drawn on a section.
- The final paper is unfolded to reveal the collaborative “exquisite corpse.”

Encourage students to be creative and to think symbolically about how their section relates to the overall theme.

Remind students that the unexpected combinations are part of the process.

Circulate and offer guidance and encouragement.

**Group Sharing and Interpretation**

Within each group, the completed exquisite corpse drawing is shared and discussed.

Ask guiding questions like:

- What was your group’s assigned theme (if applicable)?
- Describe your exquisite corpse drawing. What do you see?
- How might the different sections of your drawing connect to different aspects of peace, justice, or strong institutions?
- What ideas or feelings about Global Goal 16 does your collaborative artwork evoke?
- How does the unexpected nature of the drawing relate to the complexities of achieving Global Goal 16?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the collaborative nature of the exquisite corpse activity, where you built upon each other’s hidden contributions, reflect the idea of global partnerships for peace and justice?
- What did you learn about the power of unexpected juxtapositions and surprising combinations in art to make you think differently about complex issues like inequality or corruption?
- Did creating a piece of art where you didn’t control the whole outcome change your perspective on trust, adaptability, or the value of diverse contributions?
- How can engaging in a playful, collaborative art activity like this help to make serious topics more accessible or spark new ideas about solutions?
- What did you discover about your own creative responses when faced with an unknown starting point from a classmate?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 16 and the complexities of achieving peaceful, just, and inclusive societies through this artistic exploration?
- How did your exquisite corpse drawing, and those created by other groups, highlight different facets or challenges related to Global Goal 16 (e.g., violence reduction, access to justice, accountability, human rights)?
- Did any particular section or the overall “narrative” of an exquisite corpse piece make you think differently about a specific issues of peace or justice in your community or globally?
- What common themes or powerful messages about building a fairer world emerged across the different collaborative artworks?
- How can creating art collaboratively, without a fixed plan, mirror the unpredictable journey and diverse inputs often required for real-world efforts to achieve Global Goal 16?
- Did creating your exquisite corpse drawing spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with fairness, conflict, or teamwork?
- What emotions did you connect with during this art activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 16?
- What is one key takeaway about peace, justice, and the power of collaborative creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in promoting peace and justice in your daily life or community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and authentic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Exquisite Corpose, collaborative art creation, group sharing, and class discussions.

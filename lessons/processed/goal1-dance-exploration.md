**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an exciting movement adventure.

* Discuss that the class will be exploring a really important idea called Global Goal 1: No Poverty. Explain that this goal is all about making sure every person, everywhere, has what they need to live a good life. This means having enough food, a safe home, clean water, clothes, and a chance to go to school and feel healthy and happy. It's about fairness and making sure no one is left behind.  
* Tell students that dance and movement are amazing ways to express feelings, tells tories, and understand big ideas without even using words.   
* We can use our bodies to show challenges, feelings of hope, and how we can all work together to make things better.

Begin with a gentle warm-up up get everyone ready to move. Focus on stretching and loosening up their bodies. 

* As they stretch, guide them to think about reaching, pushing, and lifting, connecting these simple actions to the idea of working hard and trying to overcome challenges.

Examples of warm-up movements with guiding prompts:

* *Reaching:*  Let's reach our arms up high, as if we're reaching for something just out of our grasp, like a goal we're trying to achieve. (Encourage full-body stretch, maybe a slight sway).  
* *Pushing:* Imagine pushing gently against an invisible wall. What does it feel like to push? How does your body show strength and effort? (Have students push forward, or to the side, feeling resistance).  
* *Lifting:* Imagine slowly lifting something heavy off the ground, but then it gets easier. What does your body do to show that effort and then the release? (Start low, gradually rise, perhaps with arms extending).  
* *Stretching:* Stretch your body like a tree growing tall, reaching for the sun. How does your body feel when it stretches and grows stronger? (Full body extensions, reaching fingers and toes).  
* *Connecting:* Let's connect our movements to our breathing. Breathe in slowly, feeling your chest open, and breathe out, letting any tension go. This helps us focus our minds and bodies for our activity. (Simple breath awareness).

**Moving for a Fairer World**  
On the whiteboard or paper, draw a large circle. In the middle, write "A Fair World".  
Explain to students:

* We're going to build a "Community Web" of ideas. In the middle is "A Fair World", a world where everyone has what they need. What are some of the most important things every person needs to be happy and healthy?  
* Guide students towards the basic necessities. Examples:  
  * Food to eat.  
  * Clean water to drink.  
  * A safe and warm home to sleep in.  
  * Clothes to wear.  
  * Doctors and medicine when they're sick.  
  * Schools and books to learn.  
  * Kind friends and family.  
  * A chance to play and have fun.  
  * Feeling safe.  
  * Someone to listen to them.  
  * A way to learn new skills.  
  * A sense of belonging.  
* Use one color marker (e.g., blue) to write these ideas around the central circle, drawing lines connecting them to "A Fair World".

Now, introduce the contrast:

* Sometimes, people don't have enough of these important things. What happens when someone doesn't have enough food, or a safe home, or can't go to school? What challenges might they face? What does it look, sound, or feel like when people struggle with these challenges?  
* Examples:  
  * Feeling hungry  
  * Being cold.  
  * Having no safe place to sleep.  
  * Not having clean water.  
  * Not being able to go to school.  
  * Feeling left out.  
  * Feeling unsafe.  
  * Being worried.  
  * Being tired.  
  * Having worn-out clothes.  
  * Feeling sad or lonely.  
  * Having trouble learning.  
  * Being sick and without medicine.  
  * Working instead of playing.  
  * A family sharing very little.  
* Use a different color marker (e.g., red) to write these challenge ideas around the "needs" on the web, perhaps drawing lines that show how they break the connections or create difficulties.

See [Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kPbtLSr6NWa-dH3Ue11xbzhPZ-M_LFMQ/view?usp=drive_link)  
Briefly summarize:

* Our web shows how many different things contribute to a fairer world, and also the challenges people face. We're going to use our bodies to explore these feelings and situations.

Play the "Challenges" music (somber instrumental).  
	Examples:

* [Nuvole Bianche by Ludovico Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR2W2scFS4Y)  
* [Gymnopédie No. 1 by Erik Satie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMnxjdGTK4w)	

Explain that the class will be using their bodies to explore what it might feel like when people don't have enough of what they need, or face difficulties.   
Emphasize that there's no right or wrong what to move; it's about expressing how they feel or what they imagine.  
Lead students through a series of improvisational movements based on the ideas brainstormed earlier (lack of food, safe home, education, feeling safe).  
Guiding questions and movement prompts for "Challenges":

* Imagine you're trying to walk through something thick and sticky, making it hard to move forward, like walking through deep mud or struggling through a crowd. How does your body feel? How slow can you go? (Movement with resistance, heavy steps).  
* What if you were very, very hungry? How might your body feel a little tired or small, maybe trying to protect itself? (Curling inwards, slow, heavy movements, rubbing stomach gently).  
* Imagine you're trying to find a safe, warm place to rest, but you can't. How would your body search? How would you show feeling a bit lost or exposed? (Looking around, uncertain steps, shivering motions, trying to huddle or curl up).  
* Think about a time you really wanted to learn something or read a favorite book, but couldn't because you didn't have the materials. How might your body show that feeling of wanting to reach for knowledge, but something is blocking your way? (Reaching motions that get blocked or fall short, confused or frustrated gestures, head down, slumped shoulders).  
* What if you felt a little unsafe or worried? How might your body try to make itself smaller or look around nervously like you're always on alert? (Curling inwards, quick head turns, looking over shoulder, clutching arms).  
* Show me with your body what it might feel like to be very, very tired from working hard all day, with no time for play or rest. (Slumped shoulders, slow dragging steps, heavy limbs, sighing sounds).  
* What if you had a big, heavy backpack on, full of worries and problems that you couldn't put down? How would you walk? How would your shoulders feel? (Hunched over, slow, deliberate steps, hand to forehead).

After a few minutes, gently transition the music and movement.  
Switch to the "Hope and Action" music (upbeat, energetic).  
	Examples:

* [Happy by Pharrell Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs)  
* [Can't Stop the Feeling by Justin Timberlake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0K8uYEZWw)  
* [Yeke Yeke by Mory Kanté](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmS0SSSdWM)  
* [Wavin' Flag by K'naan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTJSt4wP2ME)

Explain:

* Now we'll explore what it feels like to have hope, to work together, and to make things better. Think about the things we brainstormed that everyone needs to be happy an healthy, and how people can help each other achieve them.

Lead students through improvisational movements based on the ideas of support, community, and achieving basic needs.  
Guiding questions and movement prompts for "Hope and Action":

* Imagine you're working together with friends to build something amazing for your community, like a new playground or a shared garden. How would your bodies move together? How would you show teamwork and support, maybe lifting or pushing together? (Pushing together, lifting together, side-by-side movements, gentle connection of hands/arms if comfortable, smiling)  
* What if you just received something wonderful that you really needed, like a new book or a warm meal? How would your body show that feeling of joy, relief, or gratitude? (Opening up, light steps, big smiles, reaching arms out in welcome or thanks, a small jump).  
* Show me what sharing looks like with your body. How would you offer something to someone else? How would you accept it? How does that exchange make you feel connected? (Open palms, gentle pushing/pulling motions, nodding, smiling, mirroring movements of giving and receiving).  
* Imagine you are a seed, and now you are growing into a strong, tall plant\! How do you reach for the sun? How do you grow stronger and resilient? (Starting small and curled, slowly unfurling and extending upwards, feeling the stretch).  
* Think about a time you solved a tricky problem together with friends. How does your body show that feeling of "aha\!" or success and celebration? (A sudden upright posture, hands clapping, a small jump, a collective cheer).  
* How does your body show courage and determination? What does it feel like to stand tall and brave, ready to face a challenge? (Standing tall, chest out, steady gaze, firm footing, marching in place).  
* Show me what community feels like. How do you move as a group, supporting each other and moving as one, like a connected web of friends? (Moving in a circle, mirroring movements, gentle swaying together, holding hands if appropriate).  
* What if you could spread kindness like sunshine? How would your arms move to reach out and warm everyone around, sharing positive energy? (Expansive flowing arm movements, open gestures, gentle waves).  
* Imagine you're celebrating a big success, like a community finally having fresh water or all children going to school. How would you dance with joy and excitement? (Jumping, spinning, clapping, upbeat footwork, expressive shouts of joy).

Encourage students to use their whole bodies, including facila expressions, to convey their feelings.  
**Tableau Challenge: From Challenge to Hope**  
Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).  
Explain that each group will create two frozen tableaux (like a still picture with their bodies, with no talking).

* *Tableau 1: "The Challenge":* This tableau should represent a challenge related to people not having enough basic neds (e.g., someone feeling left out, someone hungry, someone needing help, a difficulty in getting clean water).  
* *Tableau 2 "The Hope/Action":* This tableau should show how that challenge can be met with kindness, sharing, or community support, reflecting the goals of "No Poverty".

Give groups 5-7 minutes to plan and practice their two tableaux. Encourage them to think about levels (high, medium, low), body shapes, and facial expressions.  
Have each group quickly share their two tableaux with the class, explaining what each one represents.  
Affirm their creativity and their ability to show big ideas with just their bodies.  
**Cool Down**  
Lead a gentle cool-down, encouraging students to focus on their breathing and release any tension. Play calming music.  
Examples of cool-down movements with guiding prompts:

* *Deep Breathing:* Lie down or sit comfortably. Take a slow, deep breath in, feeling your belly rise. Now, breathe out slowly, letting all your worries and tension go. Imagine breathing in calm and peace, feeling your body relax. (Focus on diaphragmatic breathing deep sighs).  
* *Gentle Stretching:* Slowly stretch your arms up towards the sky, then gently reach for your toes. Feel your body release any tightness or stiffness. Imagine your body becoming light and relaxed, like a soft cloud. (Simple stretches for arms, legs, back, neck rolls).  
* *Mindfulness Walk:* Gently walk around the space, noticing each step. Feel your feet on the ground. Be present in this moment, noticing the quiet and calm around you. What doe sit feel liek to move slowly and peacefully? (Quiet, slow walking, focusing on footfalls).  
* *Tree Pose (Modified):* Stand tall and strong like a tree, rooted to the ground. Feel your balance. Imagine being strong and resilience, just like a tree that can weather any storm, stable and peaceful. (Balance on one foot, other foot resting on ankle or calf, arms extended or at prayer position, focus on stillness).  
* *Visualization:* Close your eyes (if comfortable). Imagine a world where everyone has what they need, where people are kind and helpful to one another. See happy faces, hear joyful sounds. Feel the warmth of a peaceful and fair world all around you, knowing you can be a part of it. (Guided visualization, focusing on positive imagery).

**Reflection and Summary**  
Bring the class together for a final reflection, either through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did using your body to move and create frozen pictures help you understand Global Goal 1: No Poverty in a different way?  
* What did you learn about how people might feel when they need help, or when they are helping others, through our movement?  
* Which movements or tableaux made you think or feel the most, and why?  
* What does our movement exploration tell us about how we can all work together to make sure everyone has what they need?  
* What's one small thing you can do in your own life today to show kindness or help someone who might need something?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, movement explorations, tableau challenge, and class discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concept of Global Goal 1, as demonstrated through movement choices, tableaux, and verbal contributions during discussions.  
* Originality and effectiveness in using bodies to convey emotions and ideas related to both the challenges and hopes/solutions for "no Poverty." Look for clear effort in expressing the feeling and concept.  
* Ability to work effectively within their small groups during the tableau challenge, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

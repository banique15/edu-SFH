## **Ocean’s Witness: Show, Don’t Tell For Life Below Water**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large paper

Markers


**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to UN Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the vital role of the oceans in supporting life on Earth. If wanted, review key targets and indicators.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What are some of the most pressing issues facing the oceans today?
- How do these issues affect marine life and human communities?
- How can effective storytelling help us connect with and care about the ocean?

Introduce “show, don’t tell” as a writing concept.

- “Show, don’t tell” is a writing technique that involves using vivid descriptions, sensory details, and actions to help the reader experience a scene or emotion rather than simply stating it.
- Instead of saying ‘The ocean was polluted,’ you might describe plastic bags floating on the surface, the smell of oil in the air, and the absence of vibrant marine life.

Give examples of “telling” sentences and their “showing” counterparts.

- *Telling:* The fish was scared.
- *Showing:* The fish darted behind a rock, its gills fluttering rapidly, its eyes wide
- *Telling:* The coral reef was dying.
- *Showing:* The once vibrant coral, now bleached white, crumbled at the touch. No fish darted among its branches, only a ghostly silence remained.

Emphasize the benefits of “show, don’t tell”:

- Creates a more immersive and engaging reading experience.
- Evokes stronger emotions in the reader.
- Allows the reader to draw their own conclusions and interpretations.

**“Show, Don’t Tell” Activity: Ocean Scenes**

Guide the class through a structured writing activity to practice “show, don’t tell” related to Global Goal 14.

Step 1: Initial “Telling” Sentences

- Provide a list of simple “teling” sentences related to different aspects of Global Goal 14.
- Students write down these sentences in their notebook/on their paper, or hand out a sheet with the sentences. Examples:
  - **Global Goal 14** *(Overall)*
    - There were no more fish.
    - The coral reef was dying.
    - We need to save the ocean.
  - **Target 14.1** *(Marine Pollution)*
    - The ocean was polluted.
  - **Target 14.2** *(Marine Ecosystem)*
    - The coral reef was damaged.
  - **Target 14.3** *(Ocean Acidification)*
    - The water was becoming acidic.
  - **Target 14.4** *(Sustainable Fishing)*
    - There were no more fish.
  - **Target 14.5** *(Marine Protected Areas)*
    - The marine park was beautiful.
  - **Target 14.6** *(Fisheries Subsidies)*
    - The fishermen were angry.
  - **Target 14.7** *(Economic Benefits to Small Island Developing States)*
    - The islanders depended on the sea.

  - **Target 14.3** *(Ocean Acidification) The water was becoming acidic.*
    - *Sight:* Shells dissolving in the water; coral losing its vibrant color; a lack of shellfish in the tidepools; unusual cloudiness in the water.
    - *Smell:* A faint, sharp smell in the air; the absence of the usual salty scent.
    - *Touch:* A slight burning sensation on your skin; the weakened structure of a shell.
  - **Target 14.4** *(Sustainable Fishing) There were no more fish.*
    - *Sight:* Empty fishing boats returning to shore; a barren seabed; a lack of movement in the water; small, juvenile fish struggling to survive.

Step 3: Rewriting with “Show, Don’t Tell”:

Students rewrite the original “show, don’t tell” sentences, incorporating the sensory details and actions from the brainstorming session.

Encourage students to:

- Use vivid language and strong verbs.
- Focus on specific details rather than generalization.
- Create a clear picture in the reader’s mind.
- Evoke emotions in the reader.

Examples:

- The ocean was full of plastic *becomes:*
  - Plastic bags drifted like ghostly jellyfish, their translucent bodies catching the sunlight. A rainbow sheen slicked the water’s surface, and a turtle struggled to free itself from a discarded plastic ring.
- The coral reef was damaged *becomes:*
  - Bleached white skeletons of coral, brittle and crumbling at the touch, lay scattered across the seabed. A lone fish darted nervously between the algae-covered rocks, an eerie silence replacing the once-cibrant chorus of reef like.

**Sharing and Discussion**

Students share their rewritten sentences with the class.

Facilitate a discussion:

- How did the “showing” sentences differe from the “telling” sentences?
- What impact did the sensory details have on your understanding of the scene?
- How can “show, don’t tell” make your writing more engaging and effective?
- How can this technique help us communicate the importance of Global Goal 14?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did focusing on sensory details - sight, sound, touch, smell, and even taste - change your perception of the challenges and solutions related to clean water and sanitation?
- What senses did you find most powerful in conveying the importance or the lack of clean water and sanitation in your writing/ Why?

**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that they will use their voices and the power of songs to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 10, Reduced Inequalities.  
Clarify that Global Goal 10 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has fair and equal chances. Emphasize that this means treating all people with respect, no matter their age, gender, background, abilities, or what they look like. You explain that it’s baout making sure everyone has the same opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.  
Explain that music has always been a powerful tool for this message. Introduce the characteristics of Folk Music. Clarify that folk music is often simple, and it’s music from the people. Explain that it’s often passed down from person to person and tells stories about everyday life, struggles, and the hope for a better, fairer world. Explain that folk music has been used throughout history as a way for people to have a voice and to come together to work for change.  
Show images or video clips of folk singers or people singing together, or play a few simple folk song examples.

	Facilitate a discussion about the characteristics of folk music with guiding questions like:

* What do you notice about the music? Does it sound simple? Does it sound like you could sing it too?  
* How do the lyrics of these songs connect to the ideas of fairness and equality?  
* How does hearing people sing together make you feel about big ideas like justice and hope?  
* Can you think of any examples of folk music that you have heard in your own life?

**Echoes of History**  
	Explain that the class will warm up their voices and start connecting to the tradition of music being passed down through echoing melodies.  
	*Echo the Melody*

* Play or sing a simple melody. Instruct students to listen carefully and then echo the melody back to you with their voices, as if they are passing a song down to someone else.

	*Echo with Rhythm*

* Play or sing the melody again, but this time, add a simple rhythmic clap/tap/stomp/snap/etc. to it. Instruct students to echo both the melody and the rhythm back.

	*Echo with Emotion*

* Play or sing the melody one more time, but with a specific emotional tone (e.g., determined, hopeful, joyful). Instruct students to echo the melody with their voices and add a facial expression that matches and conveys the emotion.

	Conclude warm up by affirming the listening and vocal skills, explaining that they will use these to sing a folk song about Global Goal 10\.  
**Singing Together for Justice**  
	Choose one of the simple folk songs introduced earlier. Hand out [lyric sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SRi1va0cbRrnchHLHfrUlTRYwjn_oO-S?usp=drive_link) if desired.  
	*Teaching the Song:* Start by teaching the melody and lyrics line by line. Encourage students to sing together, focusing on clear pronunciation and a joyful or determined tone.  
	*Adding Musical Elements:* Once students are comfortable with the melody and lyrics, guide them to brainstorm how to add musical elements to enhance the song’s message.

* *Rhythm and Dynamics*  
  * Ask: How can we use a steady, strong rhythm to show determination and a sense of fairness, like we are marching for what’s right?  
  * Then guide students to add clapping or stomping rhythm that fits this feeling.  
  * Ask guiding questions like:  
    * How can we use loud dynamics to show the power of our voices together?  
    * What about soft dynamics for a quiet, hopeful part?  
* *\[Optional\] Melody and Harmony*  
  * If students are comfortable, introduce a simple harmony (e.g., a sustained note, or a second part of the melody) or a round to create a richer sound.  
  * Ask guiding questions like:   
    * What does it sound like when our voices sing different notes but still blend together?  
    * How is that like a community where everyone is different but works together?  
* *Call and Response*  
  * Ask: How can we turn a part of this song into a call and response?  
  * Have one group sing a line, and the rest of the class echo it back, creating a sense of unity and participation.  
  * Ask guiding questions like:  
    * How does it feel to echo a line?  
    * How does it feel when everyone joins in?

	Guide the exploration, encouraging students to experiment with the music to express the feelings of the song.  
**Singing Together**  
	Explain that the entire class will now practice and perform the chosen folk song together. Encourage students to sing with energy and conviction, focusing on the message of the song.  
	Lead the class in a series of performances of the song, exploring different moods and interpretations.  
	Examples

* *The Quiet Start:* Sing softly at first, with a slow tempo.  
  * Ask: How does that sound make you feel about the message of fairness and equality?  
* *Building Power:* Gradually increase the volume and tempo as the class sings.  
  * Ask: How does this make our voices feel stronger and more determined?  
* *Harmony and Unity:* Try the harmony or call and response part.  
  * Ask: How does that make the song sound more full and unified, like we are all one voice?

	Encourage students to explore their own interpretations of the song, adding simple hand gestures or facial expressions to enhance their performance.

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did exploring the characteristics of folk music \- its simplicity, storytelling, and focus on everyday life \- help you connect with the complexities of reducing inequalities?  
* What did you learn about the power of music to amplify voices and unite people, especially in the context of fighting social injustices?  
* Did singing a song about fairness and equality together as a class create a sense of community or shared purpose? How did that feel?  
* What do these activities tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 10?  
* What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to promote fairness and equality, perhaps inspired by the music we made?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, folk song exploration, collaborative singing, and discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concepts of reduced inequalities (fairness, equal opportunity, inclusion, respect for all), as demonstrated through the analysis of folk song messages and the contributions to the singing activities.  
* Originality and effectiveness in applying simple musical elements (e.g., rhythm, dynamics, simple harmonies, call and response) to convey the message about inequality and social justice.  
* Ability to work effectively with peers, listen to others’ musical contributions, and collaborate constructively during group activities and whole-class singing.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

	

## **Action Planning**

Empowering youth to become active agents of change in the pursuit of reducing inequalities and promoting fairness for all. Recognizing that even small, consistent actions, sparked by their creative explorations, can contribute to a larger global impact.

**Examples:**  
Here are ways your students can extend their learning and apply their understanding of Global Goal 10 in their wider community and beyond.

**Taking Action Beyond the Classroom**

* *Become Fairness Ambassadors:* Choose a favorite piece created in the lessons, and share with family, friends, or local community groups (like a school event, digital portfolio, or community group). This allows them to use their art to tell a powerful story about why fairness and equality matter for everyone.  
  * *Concrete Action:* Aim to share their creative work related to Global Goal 10 with at least three people outside of school.  
* *Fair Play Audit:* Observe how fairness works daily, during recess, in group projects, or even at home with chores. Write a short journal entry or create a simple visual showing one instance of fairness or unfairness observed, and how it connects to Global Goal 10\.  
  * *Concrete Action:* Students create a short Fair Play observation reflecting on fairness in their own lives.  
* *Kindness Campaign:* Collaboratively create simple posters, skits, or songs to promote kindness and inclusion at school. These can feature messages like “Everyone Belongs” or “Fairness for All.”  
  * *Concrete Action:* Small groups create and perform a Kindness Campaign skit or song, or design posters to be displayed in the school hallways.  
* *Diverse Voices Story Circle:* Sit with family, friends, and community members from diverse generations and backgrounds and share stories about times they felt included, or times they saw someone stand up for what was fair.  
  * *Concrete Action:* Students initiative a Diverse Voices story circle with family, friends, or community members, sharing a story about fairness and listening to others’ perspectives.  
* *Research a Champion of Equity:* Research a real person (from history or today) who has worked to reduce inequalities and promote fairness, either locally or globally. Write a short paragraph, create a drawing, or prepare a brief presentation about this Champion of Equity, explaining how their actions connect to Global Goal 10\. This helps to see real-world examples of impact and positive change.  
  * *Concrete Action:* Research and present one Champion of Equality to share with family or the class.

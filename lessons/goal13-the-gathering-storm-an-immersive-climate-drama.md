**Introduction**

`	`Welcome students to an exciting drama class. Explain that they will use acting and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 13, Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

`	`Clarify that Global Goal 13 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to work together to protect our planet. Emphasize that this means:

- *Fighting climate change:* Working to keep the Earth healthy and safe.
- *Finding solutions:* Creating new and smart ways to power our world and live our lives.
- *Protecting our communities:* Making sure our towns and cities are strong enough to handle big storms and other weather challenges.

`	`Introduce Immersive Theater. Explain that immersive theater is a type of play where the audience is not just watching, but is a part of the story. Clarify that the audience can walk into the scene, interact with the actors, and even help change the story. Tell students that they will create a “walk-in” theater experience, where the whole class will become a commun ity, facing a climate challenge together.

`	`Show images or a short video of what immersive theater looks like.

`	`Examples:

`	`Open a discussion, asking guiding questions like:

- What are you initial ideas about what immersive theater might be like? How is it different from a normal movie or play?
- What might be the benefits of making the audience a part of the story? What could we learn from that experience?

**Warm Up: Climate Action Call & Echo**

`	`Explain that the class will play a drama warm up game, inspired by Global Goal 13.

*The Climate Action Call:* Instruct students to stand in a circle. Tell them that the first person will say a word related to climate action (e.g., solar, recycle, plant, pollution, heat, iceberg, etc.) and make a simple gesture that represents that word. This word can be loosely related and should be the first thing they think of; there are no right or wrong answers for either the word or gesture.  

*The Group Echo:* After the first person has said their word and made their gesture, the rest of the class will repeat the word and the gesture in unison, as an “echo.”

*The Next Action:* The game will then continue around the circle, with each student saying a new word and making a new gesture, and the class echoing them.

*Practice and Refine:* Have the class practice the game a few times, encouraging them to use their voices and bodies to make their words and gestures as clear and expressive as possible.

`	`Conclude warm up by affirming the quick thinking and focus, explaining that this simple exercise prepared them for the emotional storytelling of the main activity.

**The Climate Room of Feelings**

`	`*The Feeling Zones:* Physically designate three different areas in the classroom as “Feeling Zones.” These can be separate corners, the center of the room, an area of chairs/desks, etc.

- *Zone 1:* Worried Zone
- *Zone 2:* Angry Zone
- *Zone 3:* Hopeful Zone

`	`Have students walk slowly around the room exploring each zone and feeling on their own. On your signal, instruct them to move into a specific zone and explore the feeling of that zone only, using their actions/bodies.

- *Move to the Worried Zone.*
  - What does a worried body look like?
  - How does a worried person walk?
  - What does a worried face look like?
    - Students explore this feeling using actions.
- *Move to the Angry Zone.*
  - What does an angry body look like?
  - How does an angry person move? Is it a stomp? A fast movement?
  - What does a worried face look like?
    - Students explore this feeling using actions.
- *Move to the Hopeful Zone.*
  - What does a hopeful body look like?
  - How does a hopeful person move? Is it an open movement?
  - What does a hopeful face look like?
    - Students explore this feeling using actions.

`	`Have students return to their seats. Explain that they will now tell a story in a “community meeting” about a climate problem and solution. Ask students to think about how they will use the feelings they just explored in their story. Affirm the expressive abilities shown, explaining that they will use these feelings to make the stories come alive.

**Immersive Theater Performance: The Community Meeting**

`	`Explain that the class will now explore a story about climate change through immersive theater. Clarify that a small group of actors will perform a scene, and the audience (the rest of the class) will be invited to walk through the scene and feel what it is like to be a part of it. The audience’s job is not to intervene, but to observe, listen, and feel what it is like to be in this world.

`	`*Staging the Scenarios:* Arrange chairs or simple staging elements (tables, props) in the center of the room to create the setting for a community meeting or town square scenario. Choose 4-6 students to be the actors (or ask for volunteers).

`	`*The Scene:* Instruct the actors to perform a short, pre-written scene that tells a story about a climate-related problem in their community. The scene will not have a full script, but rather a clear beginning (problem), middle (discussion), and end (a solution or hopeful idea). 

`	`Explain to students that the class will perform the same scenario in a series of rounds. In each round, a new group of actors will perform while the rest of the class acts as the immersive audience. This way, there are opportunities for students to be both an actor and an observer, exploring how different choices change a story.

[Scene Examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/123FQQ6B0QyYuAXXbZSJkr6jtoI-6Eywk?usp=drive_link)

*First* Performance

- Instruct the first group of actors to take their places.
- Instruct the rest of the class to be the immersive audience. Explain their role; that as the actors perform, they should walk slowly and quietly around the space. They cannot touch or speak to the actors, just listen and observe. They can get close enough to see the actors’ faces, hear their voices, and feel the emotion in the scene. Communicate that they are a part of this community meeting, feeling what the characters are feeling.
- Have the actors perform the scene.
- After the scene is complete, have the audience return to their seats for a brief moment of reflection.

`	`*Second Performance*

- Choose 4-6 new students to perform (or ask for volunteers) the same scenario.
- Instruct the rest of the class (the audience) to now focus on a specific element of the performance. (e.g., You may ask them to focus on the body language of the actors: how certain postures or hand gestures can show emotions or feelings, etc.).
- The new group of actors will perform the scene, and the audience will observe with a new focus.
- After the scene is complete, have the audience return to their seats for a brief moment of reflection.

`	`*[Optional] Third Performance*

- You may repeat this process a third time with a new group of actors, giving the audience another new focus (e.g., vocal tone, character emotion, etc.).

`	`The repetition of the same scenario with a new focus is a powerful tool for building empathy and understanding that there are many different ways to tell the same story, and that every actor’s choice matters.

`	`Conclude the performances and bring the class together for a discussion that connects the individual performances to the broader themes of Global Goal 13. Ask guiding questions like:

- What sensations or feelings did you experience while inside of the scene as an audience member? Did you feel worry, hope, or frustration?
- What specific details did you see or hear that made the scene feel real?
- How did being able to walk through the scene affect your perspective of the story? Did seeing a character’s face up close change how you felt about their problem?
- Which actor’s portrayal of their character was most powerful for you, and what did they do with their voice or body that made their performance stand out?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the immersive nature of the theater experience, being a part of the community meeting, affect your understanding of the climate crisis as a whole?
- What did you lern about the power of this art form to communicate complex ideas in a way that just reading or talking about them can’t?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 13 and the importance of urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts through this exploration?
- What is one key takeaway about climate action and the power of the individual and collective action that you will remember from this lesson?
- What specific action, big or small, are you inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to a healthier planet?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, participation in the performance (as actors and/or audience members), and engagement in class discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of climate action (problems, solutions, and community), as demonstrated through the scenarios created and performed, engagement as an audience, and verbal explanations during discussions.
- Originality and effectiveness of the performance, including the ability to convey emotion, interact with the audience as part of the scene’s world, and improvise within the established scenario. Look for clear effort in creating a believable and immersive experience.
- Ability to work together as a class, listening to the actors and responding with respect, as well as collaborating in the small groups to create the scenarios.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion, particularly concerning the power of theater as a tool for understanding and addressing real-world issues.

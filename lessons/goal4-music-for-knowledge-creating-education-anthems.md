**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an exciting music class. Explain that we will use the power of rhyme, rhythm, and sound to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 4: Quality Education.

* Emphasize that this means ensuring everyone, everywhere, has a chance to get a great education by going to good schools, learning important and interesting things, and getting ready for the future, from little kids to grown-ups.

It's about making sure learning is fair, fun, and available for all.  
Tell students that music is a superpower. It can make us feel strong, help us remember things, and even tell powerful stories about big ideas.  
Explain that today, the class will become rhythm poets and music makers, creating their own Education Anthems that celebrate learning and talk about how we can make sure everyone gets a great education.  
**Sound Safari, Listening for Learning**  
Explain that you will go on a Sound Safari for learning. Instruct students to sit quietly and close their eyes gently if they are comfortable.   
Tell students they will listen for sounds related to learning or school, both in their imagination and around them.  
*Phase 1: Imaginary Learning Sounds*

* First, imagine a perfect classroom where everyone is learning happily. What sounds do you hear in your mind?  
  * Examples: Sounds of a pencil writing, turning pages, quiet discussion, a "ding" of understanding, a cheerful "aha\!" sound, the soft hum of computers.  
* Have students make these sounds quietly with their voices or gentle body percussion.

*Phase 2: Real Learning Sounds*

* Now, open your ears to the sounds around you in this classroom or outside. What sounds do you hear that are part of our learning environment?  
  * Examples: Fan whirring, a faint conversation, footsteps, a clock ticking, distant laughter.  
* Have students try to make rhythms or sounds that match what they hear.

*Phase 3: Building a Learning Soundscape*

* Let's combine some of these sounds to create a Learning Soundscape together. I'll make a sound, and you join in, adding yours. We'll make a gentle hum of a happy, busy classroom.  
* Start a soft, steady hum, inviting students to join and add quiet, gentle sounds/rhythms they think of.

Conclude by affirming the students' listening skills and creativity, explaining that they will use these sounds and rhythms later in their anthems.  
**Creating Our Education Anthems**  
Explain that the class will creat a Musical Mood Map for Learning on the board/paper. Everyone will think about different feelings and situations in education, and what kind of music or sounds would fit them.  
Draw two large sections on the whiteboard:

* *Sounds for Learning Challenges*  
  * What sounds, rhythms, or musical feelings would you use to show when learning is hard, or when someone can't get a good education?  
    Examples:  
    * A slow, dragging rhythm (feeling stuck)  
    * A single sad, note (feeling lonely)  
    * A loud, chaotic beat (noisy classroom)  
    * A frustrated sigh  
    * A fast, shaky sound (feeling nervous about a test, etc.)  
    * A broken rhythm (not understanding)  
    * A quiet whisper (someone afraid to speak up)  
    * Music that sounds confusing or unclear  
    * A "no" sound  
  * Write these ideas using one color marker (e.g., red)  
* *Sounds for Learning Triumps and Joy*  
  * What sounds, rhythms, or musical feelings would you use to show when learning is going great, or when everyone has the chance to get a good education?  
    Examples:  
    * A steady, strong rhythm (feeling confident)  
    * A happy, bouncy melody (fun learning)  
    * A clear, bright bell sound (understanding something new)  
    * Sounds of laughter and talking (collaboration)  
    * A "yes\!" sound  
    * Sounds of building (taps, clangs)  
    * A marching beat (progess)  
    * Uplifting music that sounds clear and bright  
    * A soaring vocal sound  
  * Write these ideas using a different color marker (e.g., blue)

**Song Exploration: Education Anthems**  
Explain that music can tell powerful stories about learning. The class will listen to a few age appropriate, short songs (or clips) that talk about learning, challenges, or achieving dreams.  
Instruct students to notice how the music makes them feel, and how the words tell a story about education. \[Optional: Use passed out lyric sheets to have students read along while listening to the song(s)\]  
Examples:

* ["What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBrd_3VMC3c) (focus on seeing and learning about the world).  
* ["The Bare Necessities" from The Jungle Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BH-Rxd-NBo) (focus on simple, essential learning/skills for life).  
* ["Try Everything" by Sharkira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6rP-YP4c5I) (from Zootopia \- focus on trying, learning from mistakes, perseverance).  
* ["Just the Way You Are" by Bruno Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjhCEhWiKXk) (focus on self-acceptance, valuing unique qualities, which is part of inclusive education).  
* ["Hall of Fame" by The Script ft. will.i.am](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk48xRzuNvA) (focus on hard work and believing in yourself to achieve great things)  
* ["How Far I'll Go" by Auli'i Cravalho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPAbx5kgCJo) (from Moana \- focus on curiosity, exploration, and the drive to discover new things and reach beyond what you know).

After the song(s), facilitate a brief discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

* What was the main message of this song about learning or growing?  
* How did the music make you feel?  
* Did any words or sounds in the song remind you of our Musical Mood Map?

**Our Learning Anthems**  
Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).  
Provide each group with a few simple percussion instruments (or additional instruments if available in your classroom) or remind them they can use body percussion/improvised instruments.  
Explain that each group will create a short Education Anthem. It will be a musical piece (about 45-60 seconds long) that uses sounds and rhythms from our Musical Mood Map. The anthem needs to celebrate learning and tlak about how we can make sure everyone gets a great education.  
Instruct groups to create their anthem with two parts:

* *The Learning Challenge:* Start with sounds and rhythms from Sounds for Learning Challenges to show a problem in education.  
* *The Learnign Solution/Triumph:* Then, without stopping, switch to sounds and rhythms from Sounds for Learning Triumphs and Joy to show how that challenge is overcome or how great learning is for all.

Encourage groups to think about:

* *Their Story:* What challenge will they show? What solution or triumph will they celebrate?  
* *Instruments/Sounds:* Which sounds from the brainstorm best fit each part of their anthem?  
* *Musical Elements:* How can they use changes in dynamics (loud/soft), tempo (fast/slow), and rhythm (steady/uneven) to show the progression from challenge to solution?  
* *Words/Phrases:* Can they include simple, repeated words or phrases (like Learn\! Together\! Yes we can\!) to make their anthem strong? Does the group want to write a short verse or chorus to give their anthem a certain message with words?  
* *Collaboration:* How will everyone in the group contribute to all parts of the musical story?

Circulate among groups, offering guidance and encouraging creativity. Ask guiding questions like:

* How can you use this \[instrument\] to make the sound of \[frustration/understanding\]?  
* Can you show the change from a challenge to a triumph with your music?  
* What kind of rhythm makes you think of a classroom working well together?  
* How can your group's sounds blend together to create a feeling of \[excitement/peaceful learning/etc.\] in the second part?  
* What's one special sound of simple word your group can add to your anthem's solution?

Have each group perform their musical piece for the class. Remind the audience to listen carefully and try to hear the story and feelings being told.  
After each performance, invite the audience to share:

* What challenge did you hear in the first part of the music?  
* What solution or positive change did you hear in the second part?  
* What message about learning and education did their anthem tell?  
* What emotions did their music make you feel?

After all groups have performed, invite each group to briefly explain their intended message:

* Our anthem showed \[challenge\] and how \[solution/triumph\] helps everyone get a great education.

**Reflection/Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did making music and sounds help you understand what makes a great education for everyone?  
* What did you learn about how different sounds and rhythms can show big feelings ab out learning, like frustration or excitement?  
* Which musical anthems today made you think or feel the most about quality education for all, and why?  
* What does our Rhythms for Knowledge activity tell us about how we can all work together to make sure everyone has a chance to learn?  
* What's one small thing you can do this week to support learning in your own classroom or community, perhaps inspired by the music we made?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, brainstorm, group music creation, and class discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concept of quality education for all, as demonstrated through the sounds, rhythms, and message in the musical pieces and verbal contributions during discussions.  
* Originality and effort in crafting musical pieces. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 4 (does the music clearly relate to a challenge in education and a solution/triumph?), and use of elements (are there attempts to use musical elements like rhythm, dynamics, sound choices, and simple vocalizations, to convey the chosen story?).  
* Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse musical choices, and collaborating cohesively to create the piece.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

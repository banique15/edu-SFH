**Closing Activity Options**  
	**One Word Summary:** Ask each student to think of one word encapsulating their biggest takeaway or feeling about equality after this art exploration. Have them share their word with the class, briefly explaining their choice. **Bonus:** Collect all the words to make a word cloud.  
	**Quote Connection:** Share an inspiring quote about equality and social justice. Facilitate an open discussion about how this quote connects to the music and activity they experienced in class. **Example:** "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." -Martin Luther King Jr.  
	**Artwork Challenge:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to create a "flash art" project with mixed media in 10 minutes. Encourage them to use symbols, metaphors, and visual storytelling to convey their message.  
	**Global Goal Gallery:** Have students work in groups to find other artwork that represents different aspects of Global Goal 10 and resonates with them. Create a digital or physical gallery to showcase these works.  
	**"Power of One" Challenge:** Ask students to write a short poem or create a simple visual metaphor (taking no longer than 10 minutes) representing the impact of individual actions on equality and fairness. (Visual metaphor example: A hand holding a sapling, with diverse hands of different skin tones reaching up from the ground, as if to support and nurture the tree.)  
	**"Equality in Action" Challenge:** Ask students to brainstorm and write down specific actions they can take to promote equality and reduce inequalities in their school, community, or the world. Encourage them to share their ideas and commit to taking action.

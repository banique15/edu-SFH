## Justice in Jest: Limericks for a Peaceful World

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

**Introduction**

Begin by introducing the limerick as a kind of poetry. Explain that it’s a five-line poem with a very specific rhyming pattern: AABBA.

The first, second, and fifth lines rhyme with each other, and the third and fourth lines rhym with each other. (All “A’s” rhyme, and all “B’s” rhyme.)

A great way to explain the rhythm is to clap or tap it out. The first, second, and fifth lines are a bit longer and have a bouncy feel, while the third and fourth lines are shorter and quicker.

Break down the rhyme scheme even more, and visually on the board/large paper, if helpful and needed:

- *Line 1:* Rhymes with lines 2 and 5. (A)
- *Line 2:* Rhymes with lines 1 and 5. (A)
- *Line 3:* Rhymes with line 4. (B)
- *Line 4:* Rhymes with line 3. (B)
- *Line 5:* Rhymes with lines 1 and 2. (A)

Introduce Global Goal 16. Explain that this goal is about building a world where everyone is treated fairly. It’s about being kind, working together to solve problems, and making sure that our communities and leaders are fair and just. 

Explain to students that this lesson will focus on how we can use the clever and funny nature of limericks to make a serious point about these important topics.

Write a sample limerick on the board/large paper and label the rhyme scheme.

Example:

There once was a mayor so bold, (A)

Whose stories were truly quite told. (A)

When he’d make a new law (B)

It would break every flaw (B)

And the people would watch all the gold. (A)

If desired, share some additional “traditional” limericks for context. Examples:

- *Oh Teenage Metabolism, Where Art Thou* by John Watt

When I was a teen, I would munch *(A rhyme)*

My way through the whole Sunday brunch. *(A rhyme)*

I’d destroy the buffet, *(B rhyme)*

Then as we walked away, *(B rhyme)*

I would ask my poor mother, “When’s lunch?” *(A rhyme)*

- *The Skateboarder* by Drjim Martin

A skateboard he tried to ride.

He didn’t there long abide.

It went airborne,

It did not forewarn,

He landed on his under side!

- *Job Interview* by Nitesh Aggarwal

There once was a boy, named Abdul;

Went to get a job, fresh out of school

All dressed up like July,

With a bow and a tie;

But left his fly open, what a fool!

NOTE: Many “traditional” limericks may be inappropriate for students. Straddle the line of communicating the fun and comedy of limericks without being inappropriate for the class.

Start a discussion about this example limerick. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are some of the things you notice about this limerick?
- Does the humor make the topic of a leader and the law easier to talk about?
- Can a short poem like this be used to make people think about big ideas?

**The Fairness Frame**

This brainstorming activity will get students to think about how they can use humor and creativity to talk about justice and peace. 

*The Situation*

- Ask students to think about a funny, simple situation that could happen in their community or in a story. Have them think about a time when something wasn’t fair, or when people didn’t get along, but make it silly.

Ask guiding questions like:

- Have you ever had to share somethingthat you really didn't want to?
- What happens when everyone wants to be the leader of a group project?
- Imagine a world where the only rule is that everyone must wear their shoes on the wrong feet.
- What if a magical rule-maker appeared, but all their rules were completely backwards and silly?
- Think of a time when you and a friend disagreed on the rules of a game. How did that feel?

*The Challenge*

- Ask students to think about a problem or challenge that could be related to this situation. 

Ask guiding questions like:

- In our funny situation, what goes wrong?
- What is the problem that will need to be fixed?
- What is the most unfair part of the situation, and how does it make the characters feel? 

*The Twist*

- Ask students to think about a funny or clever solution to the problem.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How could this problem be solved in a surprising, funny, or even weird way?
- What if a magical object or a weird rule appeared to make things fair again?
- How could the characters use something that's totally useless in a weird, new way to solve their issue? 

This activity will help students connect the serious concepts of fairness and justice with a lighthearted, imaginative approach, while using the basic structure of a limerick.

**Collaborative Limerick Creation**

Tell the class that they will now work together to write a limerick. The goal is to show students how they can build a poem, line by line, with everyone’s help.

*Line 1 (A):* Ask for a volunteer to give the first line of the limerick. It should introduce a character or a situation and set up the main idea.

Example:

- A leader who was so very grand

*Line 2 (A):* Ask for another volunteer to give the second line, which must rhyme with the first. This line can be more flexible and can set up the challenge, or get more specific about the character or situation introduced in the last line.

Example:

- Got stuck in a pile of wet sand

*Lines 3 & 4 (B):* Guide the class as a whole to write the two shorter lines, together, which will have a new rhyme. This is where the story’s twist or main action happens.

Example:

She wiggled and shook

With a comical look

*Line 5 (A):* Ask for a volunteer to write the final line, which must rhyme with lines 1 and 2, and provide a clever conclusion. If this student needs assistance, have the class chime in and help, collaboratively.

Example:

- And learned a lesson on land!

Work together as a class to write a few more limericks, each on a different theme from Global Goal 16, such as fairness in a game or honest leadership. Have student volunteers read the completed limericks outloud.

**Group Sharing and discussion**

After at least a few limericks have been created and read, have a class discussion about the process and final product:

Ask guiding questions like:

- What was the most challenging part of writing a limerick?
- Which of our limericks was the most memorable? Why?
- How does the humor in our limericks make the message of Global Goal 16 easier to understand?
- How did working together, line by line, feel like a form of teamwork and community?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- What did you learn about the power of rhythm and rhyme to make a message stick in your head?
- How did using humor help us talk about a serious topic like fairness?
- What is one thing you can do to help make your classroom or community a more fair and peaceful place?
- How can you use your voice to advocate for justice, even in a small way?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, collaborative writing, and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., peace, justice, fairness) as demonstrated through the thematic content of the limericks and contributions to the discussions.
- Originality and effectiveness in contributing to limericks that adhere to the AABBA rhyme scheme and general rhythm.
- How clearly and cleverly the collaboratively written limericks communicate the intended message. Did the humor and wit effectively draw attention to the social issue?
- Ability to work effectively as a class, contributing ideas for each line, listening to and building upon classmates’ suggestions, and collaborating cohesively to complete the poems.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for social justice and the complexities of achieving peace and fairness.

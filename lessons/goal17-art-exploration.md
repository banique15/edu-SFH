Provide a brief introduction to the artwork(s), including any background and/or context that might be important.

Adjust the level of guidance based on the students’ age and/or pror knowledge of art.


**Discussion**

- What emotions does this artwork evoke in you?
- What aspects of collaboration of interconnectedness does the artwork highlight?

- How do these artworks relate to the goals of Global Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals?

- What symbols or visual elements stand out to you and what might they represent in the context of global partnerships?

Emphasize how art can be a powerful tool for expressing ideas, fostering understanding, and inspiring action around global collaboration.

**Personal Connection**

Ask students to reflect on their own experiences with the partnerships and working together towards a common goal. Ask questions like:

- Think about a time you worked with a group of people to achieve something. What made the collaboration successful or challenging?
- Have you ever been part of a team or club where different people brought different skills and perspectives? How did that contribute to the group’s success?
- What are some global issues that you think require different countries and organizations to work together?
- What role do you think young people can play in building partnerships for sustainable development?
- What are some examples of partnerships you see in your school or community?

Encourage students to share their personal stories and connect them to themes explored in the artwork.

- **Quote Connection:** Share an inspiring quote about collaboration or global unity. Facilitate an open discussion about how this quote connects tot he artwork and activity they experienced in class. *Example:* “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller “The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.” - Phil Jackson
- **Artwork Challenge:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to create a “flash partnership art” project in 10 minutes using only the materials available in the classroom. Encourage them to visually represent the idea of different entities working together towards a shared goal.
- **Global Goal Gallery:** Have students work in groups to find other artwork that represents different aspects of Global Goal 17 and resonates with them.

**Introduction**  
	Ask students "What does a healthy world look like to you?"  
	Briefly explain the various targets within Goal 3, using simplified language and real-world examples:

* *Target 3.1 \- Maternal Health:* "Every mom deserves a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, no matter where they live."  
* *Target 3.2 \- Child Survival: "*Imagine a world where no child dies from preventable diseases like measles or diarrhea"

* *Target 3.8 \- Universal Health Coverage:* "Picture a reality where everyone can see a doctor or get medicine without worrying about the cost."

* *Target 3.d \- Global Health Risks:* "Think of it like a global health watch system; it can potentially help countries prepare for and respond to outbreaks and other health threats so we can all live healthier lives."

**Character Creation: Stepping into Someone Else's Shoes**  
	Assign each student (or pair) one of the Global Goal 3 Targets  
	Guide them to create a fictional character whose life is directly impacted by the chosen issue. Examples:

* *Target 3.1:* A midwife in a remote village struggling to provide safe childbirth care with limited resources.  
* *Target 3.2:* A parent in a refugee camp desperately seeking medical care for their sick child.  
* *Target 3.3:* A young woman in a rural village battling malaria.  
* *Target 3.4:* A person struggling with depression, trying to find the courage to seek help.

* *Target 3.c:* A nurse in a rural clinic overwhelmed by the number of patients and lack of resources.  
* *Target 3.d:* An epidemiologist tracking the spread of a new infectious disease, trying to prevent a global pandemic.

**Narrative Writing: A Day in the Life**  
	Instruct students to write a short sotry or vignette in the third-person limited point of view, focusing on a single day in their character's life.  
	Explain to students how to write in third-person narrative if needed:

* *"He/She/They" Focus:* Tell the story using pronouns like "he," "she," or "they" to refer to your character.  
* *One Perspective:* The story is told from the viewpoint of **one** character. You'll see the world through **their** eyes, know **their** thoughts and feelings, but not anyone else's directly.  
* *Limited Knowledge:* You only know what **your** character knows. If they're surprised by something, the reader is too. No peeking into other people's heads\!  
* *Example:* "Sarah nervously clutched her vaccination card. "Will this protect me?" she wondered, glancing at the crowded clinic. "It has to."

	Encourage students to:

* Vividly describe their character's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings.  
* Show the challenges they face due to the health issue.  
* Hint at their hpes, dreams, or resilience in overcoming these challenges.  
* Consider including interactions with other characters that highlight the social and community impact of the health issue.

	Example Prompts:

* *Target 3.1:* "Amina woke up before sunrise, the contractions already starting. She knew the journey to the nearest clinic would be long and arduous…"  
* *Target 3.2:* "Aisha rocked her feverish baby, her heart heavy with worry. The nearest clinic was miles away, and the dirt roads were treacherous. "Please, just hold on a little longer," she whispered, tears streaming down her face."  
* *Target 3.3:* "Kojo coughed, his chest tight. Each breath was a struggle. He knew he needed to see the doctor, but the long walk to the clinic seemed impossible…"  
* *Target 3.4:* "David sat on the edge of his bed, the weight of the world pressing down on him. He knew he needed help, but the stigma surrounding mental health kept him silent…"  
* *Target 3.5:* "Emily hid the empty bottle under her bed, shame washing over her. "Just one more day," she told herself, "then I'll quit."  
* *Target 3.7:* "Elena's heart pounded as she entered the family planning clinic. "I need to take control of my future," she thought, "but will they understand?"  
* *Target 3.8:* "Maria clutched her daughter's hand tightly as they waited in the crowded clinic. The cost of medicine was exorbitant, but she would do anything to save her child's life…"  
* *Target 3.9:* "Every morning, Xiao woke to a thick smog that stung his eyes and made it hard to breathe. "How much longer can we live like this?" he thought, anger rising in his chest."  
* *Target 3.a:* "Dr. Singh sighed, looking at the stack of tobacco-related illness reports on his desk. 'Another day, another battle,' he thought. 'But we will not give up. We will make our country healthier.'"  
* *Target 3.b:* "Dr. Patel peered into the microscope, her eyes focused on the tiny, deadly pathogen. 'We are so close,' she muttered, her fingers tracing the intricate molecular structure. 'This vaccine could save countless lives.'"  
* *Target 3.c:* "Nurse Fatima's shift had long ended, but the waiting room was still full. Exhaustion gnawed at her, but she pushed through, knowing each patient deserved her full attention. 'One more, then I rest,' she promised herself, her smile unwavering."  
* *Target 3.d:* "The alert flashed across Dr. Kim's screen \- a new cluster of cases in a remote village. 'We have to move fast,' she said, her voice firm. 'Every second counts in containing an outbreak.'"

**Sharing and Connecting**  
	Create a safe space for students to share excerpts from their narratives.  
	Encourage active listening and thoughtful questions.  
	Guide a discussion connecting the stories to the broader themes of Global Goal 3:

* How do these individual stories reflect the global challenges we face in achieving health and well-being for all?  
* What common threads or themes emerge from the different narratives?  
* How can we, as individuals and as a global community, contribute to solutions?

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did writing from a third-person limited perspective help you step into someone else's shoes and understand their health challenges?  
* What were some of the most powerful or moving moments you wrote, and what did you learn from exploring those moments?  
* Did focusing on a single day in your character's life give you a deeper appreciation for the ongoing struggles they might face?  
* How did limiting your perspective to your character's thoughts and feelings affect the way you told their story?  
* What did you learn about the importance of empathy and understanding in addressing global health challenges?  
* How did the different stories shared by the class help you see the interconnectedness of various health challenges around the world?  
* What did you learn about your own capacity for empathy and creative expression through this writing exercise?  
* What are some of the key takeaways from the stories shared gtoday that you think are important for others to understand about global health challenges?

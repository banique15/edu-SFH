**Introduction**

Introduce musical mapping to the class.

- Musical mapping is a creative way to translate non-musical information - like a story, an emotion, or a series of events - into musical elements. We assign different aspects of the information to musical parameters such as tempo, pitch, dynamics (loudness), and instrumentation.
- Think of it as creating a blueprint for a song based on a narrative or a concept, rather than traditional musical notation.
- We will use this technique to explore the themes of peace, justice, and strong institutions.

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Emphasize the importance of these principles for a thriving global community.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:

- Reducing violence and promoting safety.
- Ending abuse and exploitation.
- Combating corruption and organized crime.
- Building effective and inclusive institutions.
- Promoting participation and access to information.

Connect musical mapping and Global Goal 16 by engaging the class in a discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use musical elements to represent abstract ideas like peace or injustice? For example, what kind of tempo might represent urgency for change? What dynamics might symbolize the strength of institutions? What kind of instruments could represent different voices in a community?

Start with a story related to Global Goal 16 and collectively create a musical map that captures its essence.

**Storytelling and Musical Mapping**

Use of one the story examples, write your own, or, if time permits, the class can write a story together based on Global Goal 16).

Read the chosen story connected to Global Goal 16 as a class and discuss.

Start the collective musical mapping, guiding the class through the chosen story, scene by scene or key emotional moment by key emotional moment.

For each part of the story, ask students to suggest musical elements that could represent it:

- *Tempo:* What tempo (fast, slow, moderate) would capture the pace of events or the feeling?
- *Dynamics:* What general pitch direction (high, low, rising, falling) might symbolize hope, despair, tension, resolution, etc.?
- *Instrumentation:* What kind of sounds could represent different characters or moments/feelings? 
- Write these ideas on the whiteboard or large paper, creating a “musical map” of the story.

Musical Map Examples

**AI Song Generation**

Introduce the concept of using AI music generators. Explain that these tools can take a set of instructions (our musical map) and create a song based on those parameters.

As a class, translate the musical map into simple terms that can be inputted into the AI music generator. This might involve choosing general moods (e.g., tense, hopeful, calm), tempo indications (e.g., fast, slow), and describing the kinds of sounds (e.g., percussive, melodic, ambient).
Input the parameters into a beginner-friendly AI music generator.

Listen to the song generated by the AI together as a class.

Facilitate a class discussion focused on the AI’s musical interpretation of the musical map and its connection to Global Goal 16.

Ask guiding questions like:

- What were your initial reactions to the song created by AI?
- How well do you think the AI captured the different moments or emotions of the story we mapped?
- Did the tempo of the AI’s song reflect the pace of events in our story? Where did it speed up or slow down, and why might that be?
- How did the dynamics (loudness and softness) in the song contribute to the feeling of the story? Were there moments of tension, release, or resolution that were reflected in the volume?
- Even without specific instruments, did the overall ‘sound’ or texture of the music evoke the moods we intended for different parts of the story (e.g., tension, hope, unity)?
- Thinking about Global Goal 16 and the specific target our story addressed, how effectively did the musical interpretation convey the importance or the challenges related to the goal?
- Were there any surprises in the interpretation? Did it highlight aspects of the story or Goal 16 in ways you hadn’t considered?
- If we were to refine our musical map and feed it back into the AI, what specific instructions might we change to better capture the nuances of the story and the message of Global Goal 16?
- How does this process of translating abstract ideas into musical parameters and then hearing an AI interpretation make you think differently about the power of music to communicate complex themes?

**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the process of creating a musical map for our story help you understand the complexities of peace, justice, and strong institutions in a new way?
- What did you learn about how musical elements (tempo, dynamics, pitch, instrumentation) can represent abstract concepts like conflict, resolution, transparency, or unity?
- Did translating the narrative into musical parameters make you think differently about the emotional arc or key moments of the story?
- How can music, even abstractly, help us to connect with and empathize with the challenges and triumphs related to Global Goal 16?
- What did you discover about the power of music as a language that can communicate ideas across different backgrounds and understandings?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 16 and its themes of peace, justice, and strong institutions through this musical mapping activity?
- How did workign with an AI music generator impact your creative process or your understanding of music composition?
- Did AI’s interpretation of your musical map highlight any aspects of the story of Global Goal 16 that you hadn’t fully considered before?
- What are the benefits and challenges of using technology like AI to explore and express complex social issues through music?
- How can a collaborative musical experience like this (from story to map to AI song) help to galvanize collective action for a more just and peaceful world?
- Did the sotry or the musical interpretation resonate with you personally in relation to issues of peace, justice, or fairness in your own community or globally?
- What emotions or motivations did you experience during this lesson, and how might they inspire you to take action related to Global Goal 16?
- What is one key takeaway about peace, justice, and the power of music and technology for social change that you will remember from this lesson?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in promoting peace and justice in your daily life or broader society?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial story discussion, collaborative musical mapping, engaging with the AI music generator, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., violence reduction, access to justice, strong institutions, combating corruption) as demonstrated through the choices for musical parameters (tempo, dynamics, instrumentation) that directly reflect narrative elements and themes.
- Originality and thoughtfulness in translating non-musical concepts (story moments, emotions, character arcs) into specific, effective musical parameters for the map.
- Ability to critically listen to and analyze the AI-generated song, articulating how well it captured the intended story and emotions, and suggesting specific ways to refine the musical map for better results.
- Ability to work effectively as a class, contributing ideas for the musical map, listening to and building upon classmates’ suggestions, and engaging respectfully during the AI exploration and discussion.
- Nuance and insight demonstrated in reflection, particularly concerning the role of music and technology in understanding complex social issues and achieving peace and justice.

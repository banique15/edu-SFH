**Introduction**

Begin by introducing the art style of Dadaism. Explain that Dada artists were alive during a time of great conflict, and they felt that the world haad stopped making sense. So, they decided to make art that didn’t make sense as a reaction to the world around them, to show that creativity could come from anywhere. They loved to use items you wouldn’t expect in “high art” at the time, like old newspaper clippings, buttons, and even pieces of trash. Their art reminds us that every single thing, no matter how small or strange, can be a part of something beautiful.

To illustrate this, show students some examples of Dada Art.

Examples:

- [Collages by Kurt Schwitters](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=cb1e697b99ad7555&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&udm=2&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeiAkWG4OlBE2zyCTMjPbGmMU8EWskMk2JSE__efdUJ3xRFvZ0M2vJLB0hUMk5HOE2JYHbn8EkAxflxA6nxAnoThAuIcN7xDcumLPe-3cEEp0BCRKPiuNemU71V5H4BQp-rSd0ykhtsWXyWSGI_xAj-MEbBR2jUQBsnSDsPt34j9ah4jECw&q=kurt+schwitters+collages&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi52OzomtGPAxW2w_ACHengKM4QtKgLegQINRAB&biw=1327&bih=671&dpr=2) show unexpected items being used. Explain that he made art from garbage and items he found on the street.

Explain that she put pieces of people and places together in new ways to tell new stories.

After showing the examples, introduce UN Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships. It means that for us to solve big problems like climate change or poverty, we need people from all over the world to work together. This is a bit like Dadaism; a collection of different parts coming together to create one larger, meaningful thing.

**The Partnership Puzzle Brainstorm**

Tell students that they will participate in a brainstorming activity, where the goal is to think about the different pieces of a partnership.

*What Does a Partnership Need?*

- Ask students to imagine wanting to build a really cool treehouse with their friends. Ask guiding questions to get them thinking about the ingredients of a good partnership, like:
  - What would you need to make it happen?
  - Do you and all your friends need to be good at the same things?
  - Do you need to share your supplies?
- Ask students to share their ideas, and write them on the board or paper.
- Examples of keywords to write on the board: 
  - Trust
  - Teamwork
  - Different Skills
  - Sharing
  - A Plan
  - A Common Goal

*What Does It Look Like?*

- Ask students to think about how they would represent these broad ideas in a picture. Prompt them with guiding questions like:
  - How can we show these ideas in a collage?
  - What materials could we use to show “teamwork” or “sharing”?
- Examples of ideas to brainstorm: 
  - Cutting a piece of paper in half and giving one part to a friend (sharing).
  - Using different colored paper or different types of materials to show that everyone has a unique contribution (different skills).
  - Placing all the pieces of the collage so they point to a central object or shape (common goal).
  - Gluing something in an interesting or “weird” spot and then finding a creative way to build around it (problem-solving).

These words and ideas will serve as a creative resource for students during their art activity.

**The Collaborative Collage**

Now, students will split into small groups (3-4 students). Each group will create a large collaborative collage that tells a story about a partnership.

Each group will:

- Receive a large piece of poster board or paper to work on.
- Work together to choose materials and a story for their collage.
- Work as a team, taking turns adding elements to the shared surface.

Encourage spontaneity, reminding students to embrace the Dada idea of randomness and chance. Instruct them not to plan everything perfectly, and that the most interesting partnerships can come from unexpected combinations and ideas. The final art piece will be a surprise that shows how many different ideas can come together to form one whole.

**Group Sharing and Interpretation**

After all groups have finished their collages, they will share with the rest of the class. This is a chance for students to talk about their art and see how their classmates interpreted the same ideas.

While groups are sharing, ask guiding questions to open the discussion, like:

- How does your collage show that different people and ideas came together to create one thing?
- What was the most challenging part of working together on this project?
- What was the most surprising or fun part?
- How does your collage show the big idea of Global Goal 17?

This activity is a great way to reinforce that collaboration is a process of building on each other’s ideas, even if the result isn’t what you expected.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did this art project help you understand Global Goal 17 in a new way? Did it feel different from just reading about it?
- What did you learn about working with others on a project? How is that like being a part of a community?
- What did you learn about the importance of everyone’s contributions, no matter how small, for a big project?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, collaborative art creation, and group sharing and discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., teamwork, sharing, different skills) as demonstrated through the symbolism in the collaborative art and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying the collage method, embracing its collaborative nature and the unexpected juxtaposition of individual contributions.
- How clearly and powerfully the finished collaborative artwork communicates its intended message. Did the piece successfully provoke thought or emotion related to global partnerships?
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse artistic choices, and collaborating cohesively to create the shared piece.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening and the ability to articulate what they observed and learned from classmates’ artwork.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in advocating for global cooperation and the complexities of building effective partnerships.

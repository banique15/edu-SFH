## Jazz Voices: Improvising Global Partnerships

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Audio
Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper 

Pens/pencils

“Instruments” (Body Percussion and Voices) Students’ bodies (clapping, snapping, stomping, etc.), voices (for simple vocalization and rhythms)

Whiteboard or large paper

**Introduction**

`	`Begin by introducing UN Global Goal 17. Explain that this goal is all about partnerships; the idea that for us to solve big problems like hunger or climate change, we can’t do it alone. We need to work together as a team, as a community, and as a world.

`	`You can break down the goal into a few simple ideas:

- *Teamwork:* The goal recognizes that everyone, from world leaders to students in a classroom, has a role to play.
- *Sharing:* It’s about sharing ideas, knowledge, and resources so that every country has what it needs to succeed.
- *Working Together:* It’s about making sure that all our efforts are connected, so that we can create a stronger, better future for everyone.

`	`Open a short class discussion to get students thinking about what good partnerships look like, asking guiding questions like:

- What does a good partnership look like?
- What makes a team successful?
- Can a partnership still be strong even if the people in it are different? Why or why not?

`	`Next, introduce the main ideas of jazz music. Explain that jazz is a type of music that is all about working together.

- *The Team:* In a jazz band, you have a rhythm section (like the drums and bass) that keep a steady beat. This is like the foundation of a house.
- *The Voice:* Then, you have a melody (the main tune) that is played by a saxophone, trumpet, etc. This is like the unique voice of a person or country.
- *The Conversation:* The coolest part of jazz is called improvisation. This is when a musician makes up their own melody on the spot, but they are still listening and playing with the rest of the band. It’s like a conversation where everyone gets to say something different, but it all makes sense together.
- *The Call and Answer:* Another important part of jazz is call and response. This is when one musician plays a short musical idea, and another musician “answers” it. This is a lot like a conversation in real life.

**Our Jazz Story**

`	`Now, the class will connect the jazz rhythms to the ideas of Global Goal 17. Use a simple, repetitive jazz track with a clear rhythm section as the foundation.

`	`Examples:

- [Easy Jazz Backing Track (Medium Swing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mir959i7F2M)
- [Jazz Guitar Backing Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mss0u20GmBo&t=19s)
- [Jazz Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFx3-ciqlug)
- [Jazz Backing Track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9PeqG9C5os)

`	`*A Shared Problem (The Blues):*

- Start (can be you or a student) a slow, sad rhythm to represent a shared problem, like not enough clean water.
- The class will pass this rhythm around, seeing how it feels to share a problem.

`	`*A New Idea (Improvisation):*

- When the rhythm gets back to the first person or student, have them “improvise” and create a new, hopeful rhythm. This new rhythm can represent a new idea or a solution.

`	`*A Collective Solution (Harmony):*

- As this new, hopeful rhythm is passed around the room, ask the rest of the class to join in, creating a collective, unified sound. This shows how a good idea can spread and how everyone’s voice can be a part of the solution.

`	`Repeat this as many times as you’d like, pointing out different rhythms and feelings about the rhythms throughout. 

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did creating our jazz rhythms help you feel what it’s like o be part of a team?
- What did you learn about the importance of listening to others in a conversation to build a partnership?
- What did you learn about how your own unique voice or idea can be a part of a bigger solution?
- What is one thing you can do to be a better partner in your own life, whether it’s at school or with your family or friends?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to jazz, rhythmic improvisation, and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., collaboration, improvisation, communication) as demonstrated through the choices for rhythmic patterns and vocalizations that reflect these concepts.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying beginner-friendly jazz elements (e.g., creating a rhythm section, improvising melodies, performing call-and-response) within the collaborative music activity.
- How clearly and powerfully the collective rhythmic piece communicated its intended message. Did the combined sounds successfully evoke thought or emotion related to global partnership?
- Ability to work effectively within the groups and as a whole class, demonstrating active listening, responsive rhythmic contributions, and cohesive collaboration during the improvisation.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening and the ability to articulate what they observed and learned from the collective performance.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of music and improvisation in advocating for global cooperation and the complexities of building effective partnerships.

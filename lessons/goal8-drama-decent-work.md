[Job Dilemma Cards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13v_29SmrOnDX0SUih95CzTdcM0oTXJa1s7oeaCihpDw/edit?usp=sharing): Prepared small slips of paper or index cards (one card per small group). Each will have a short scenario describing a simple problem or challenge related to getting a good job, being fair at work, or economic growth that isn't helping everyone. Each card will also suggest 2-4 characters.  
\[Optional\] Costumes and props (simple items like hats, aprons, tools, paper money, signs \- emphasis on imagination over realism)  
**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an exciting drama class. Explain that they will use acting and imagination to explore a really important topic: Global Goal 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth.  
Clarify that Global Goal 8 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to make sure everyone, everywhere, has a good job \- one that is fair, safe, and where they are treated with respect. Emphasize that it's also about helping communities and countries grow stronger in a way that helps everyone and doesn't harm our planet. Explain this means jobs that are safe, pay fairly, and help the world be a better place.  
Explain that drama is a powerful way to bring stories to life, show feelings, explore problems, and even think about solutions. Clarify that actors use their voices, bodies, and imaginations to transform into different characters and situations.  
Tell students that today, they will all become job storytellers, acting out scenes about different kinds of work, the challenges people face, and how we can work towards a world with decent work and growth for all.  
**Warm Up: Workday Transformation**  
Explain that students will transform everyday action into exaggerated "workday moves" that show different job feelings.   
Instruct students to stand up and find their own space, with enough room to move around.  
*Everyday Start*

* *Say*: You're getting ready for your school day. Show me a very normal, tired stretch in the morning.  
  * Demonstrate a simple, sleepy stretch for students to follow.  
* Say: Now, transform that stretch into a super strong, ready to work stretch of a builder or a farmer.  
  * Demonstrate big, powerful stretches for students to follow.

*The Daily Grind*

* Say: Show me a very normal walk to class.   
  * Demonstrate a normal walk, students follow.  
* Say: Now, transform that into the exaggerated, repetitive walk of someone walking a very long way to work.  
  * Demonstrate a hunched, slow, repetitive walk, students follow.

*The Breakthrough*

* You just heard a fantastic idea for a new, fair way to work\! Show me an exaggerated burst of excitement or a "lightbulb" moment.  
  * Demonstrate and students mime big, sudden movements, wide eyes, huge smile, maybe a jump.

*Fair and Proud Walk*

* Show me the smooth, proud movements of someone doing fair work that they love. How do you move when you feel respected and happy at your job?  
  * Students move with open, confident, flowing gestures, happy faces.

Conclude the warm up by affirming their expressive abilities.  
**Job Dilemma Cards**  
Divide the class into small groups of 3-5 students. Explain that each group will receive a Job Dilemma card with a real-life work situation, and their job will be to brainstorm how to act it out.  
Note: If using the example Job Dilemma Cards, feel free to remove characters as needed to match the number of students in each group.  
Provide each group with their one pre-written Job Dilemma card.  
[Job Dilemma Card Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13v_29SmrOnDX0SUih95CzTdcM0oTXJa1s7oeaCihpDw/edit?usp=sharing)  
Instruct each group to look at their card.   
Ask: What is the job? What is the problem or challenge? Who are the characters?  
Tell students their challenge is to quickly discuss and prepare a short, silent scene (about 1 \- 2 minutes long) about this dilemma. Have the groups focus on showing the characters' feelings and the problem clearly. Students can use movement and improvised dialogue, have them think about what their characters would say to each other in this situation.  
Example Discussion Points for Groups:

* Who will play each character listed on the card?  
* What are the most important actions and lines to show the problem clearly for the audience?  
* How will you show the characters' feelings (e.g., frustration, tiredness, worry, pride, unfairness) using your voice and body language?  
* What might your characters say to each other in this moment?  
* What simple props (optional) could you use to make the scene clearer?  
* What do you think is the main problem this job dilemma shows us about decent work or economic growth?

Give groups 5-7 minutes to quickly discuss their dilemma, assign roles, and decide on a few actions or spoken phrases to show their scene.   
Circulate, offering guidance and encouragement, prompting them to think about how they will clearly show the problem for the audience.  
**Exploring Drama Techniques**  
Quickly review some drama techniques with the class that will help them bring their Job Dilemma scenes to life:

* *Role-Playing:* Instruct students that they will step into the shoes of their characters. Ask them to think about:  
  * How would this character walk?  
  * How would their voice sound (high, low, fast, slow, loud, soft)?  
  * What's their main feeling?  
* Have students practice walking/speaking as their character briefly.  
* *Scene Creation (Blocking and Action):* Explain that a scene needs clear actions. Guide students to understand:  
  * Show, don't tell.  
  * If a character is worried, don't just say it, act it. Wring your hands, pace, or frown.  
  * If a character is building something, mime the tools.  
  * What would a character say while doing something?  
* Have students quickly rehearse a single action from their group's dilemma, focusing on showing it clearly with both voice and body language.  
* *Improvisation:* Remind students that improvisation means making things up on the spot, reacting naturally to their group members and the situation. Explain that they don't need a full script; they can trust themselves to find the words and actions.  
  * *Give a simple prompt:* (ex. Your character just discovered something missing that they need. Show their reaction\!)  
* Have students quickly improvise the reaction to the prompt given.

**Scene Creation: Our Work Stories**  
Explain that the groups will now use their brainstormed ideas and learned drama techniques to perform their short Job Dilemma scenes. Remind them to clearly show the problem on the card.  
Designate a performance space.  
Have each group perform their short scene, clearly depicting the challenge or conflict from their Job Dilemma card.  
After each scene, invite the audience to share. Ask guiding questions like:

* What job did you see in the scene? What was the main problem or challenge they faced?  
* What emotions did the characters show? How did the actors use their voices or bodies to show those feelings?  
* What did this scene make you think about decent work or economic growth?

Repeat the process for all groups.  
**Cool Down: The Steady Pulse of Progress**  
This cool down connects directly to the lesson's themes of work, stability, and growth, promoting a calm, collective feeling and classroom.  
Explain that the class will now bring down their energy. Instruct the class to be seated in a circle formation, in a position comfortable for them. They can gently close their eyes if comfortable.  
*Inner Pulse*

* Say: Gently place one hand over your heart. Feel your own steady pulse. Imagine this pulse is the constant, fair rhythm of good and fair work happening all over the world.  
  * Guide students to focus on their heartbeat.

*Collective Pulse*

* Say: Now, very gently, begin to tap a soft, steady rhythm with one finger on your leg. Imagine this rhythm joining with everyone else's rhythm in the room, creating one big, calm, powerful pulse of progress. Feel how strong we are together.  
  * Guide the class to create a very quiet, unified rhythmic pulse, bringing all the separate rhythms together.

*Breath of Growth*

* Say; As you keep this gentle beat, take a deep breath in, imagining you're breathing in hope and fairness. As you breathe out slowly, imagine sending out kindness and progress into the world. Feel steady and peaceful.  
  * Guide 2-3 deep breaths with the steady gentle tapping, focusing on positive visualization.

Gently guide students to let their tapping fade to stillness, returning to quiet breathing, feeling calm and connected to the idea of fair and steady progress and work for all.  
Bring students back by wiggling fingers and toes before opening their eyes, feeling calm and ready.

**Reflection & Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did acting out different job challenges help you understand Global goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth in a new way?  
* What did you learn about what makes a "good" job and how economic growth can be fair for everyone?  
* Which scenes or ideas from your classmates made you think or feel the most about jobs and growth, and why?  
* What's one small action you feel inspired to take this week to be fair in your own work (like homework or chores) or support good work in your community?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, group scene creation, and class discussion.  
* Understanding of the core concept of decent work and economic growth (fair jobs, safe workplaces, sustainable growth), as demonstrated through the content and verbal explanations within the improvised scenes.  
* Originality and effectiveness in performing the scenes. Look for evidence of character portrayal (does the student effectively embody the character through voice, body language, and facial expressions?), clear problem (does the scene clearly communicate the job dilemma or challenge?), emotional conveyance (are emotions related to the dilemma shown effectively through acting?), use of improvised dialogue (is the dialogue natural and does it advance the scene?), and collaboration (does the group work together to create a cohesive scene?).  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

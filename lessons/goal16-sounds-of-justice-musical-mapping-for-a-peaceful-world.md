## Sounds of Justice: Musical Mapping for a Peaceful World

**(30-60 MINUTES)**


**Materials:**

Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper 

Pens/pencils

A variety of percussion instruments (drums, shakers, woodblocks, tambourines, etc.)

Body percussion (clapping, snapping, stomping, etc.)

**Introduction**

Begin by introducing the concept of musical mapping. Explain that it’s like creating a blueprint for a song based on a story. It’s a way for us to use music to tell a story without using any words. Tell the class that they will use this technique to explore an important and big idea: Global Goal 16.

Explain that Global Goal 16 is all about creating a worldwhere everyone is safe, treated fairly, and has a voice. It’s about building strong communities and trustworthy leaders. 

Open a discussion about how a story can be turned into music. Ask guiding questions like:

- What would a fast tempo sound or feel like?
  - Fast, quick, exciting, maybe a little tense, etc.
- What would a slow tempo sound or feel like?
  - Calm, sad, peaceful, etc.
- What feelings or moments would a loud sound be for?
  - Anger, a big argument, a powerful moment, etc.
- What feelings or moments would a quiet sound be for?
  - A secret, a moment of sadness, a calm feeling, etc.
- What kind of sounds could represent different characters or ideas?
  - A strong drum for a leader, a gentle shaker for a quiet voice, a clashing cymbal for a conflict, etc.

This discussion will help students start to understand the basic tools of musical mapping.

**Storytelling and Musical Mapping**

Choose one of the provided stories (or write your own) about Global Goal 16. Read the story to the class and discuss the main ideas, characters, and emotions. For this lesson, focus on the story’s overall arc - the problem, the action, and the solution.

*The Problem*

- Prompt students to focus on the beginning of the story, and call their attention to the problem. 
- Ask what musical elements could be used to show this problem, and guide the class to brainstorm sounds.
  - For example, if the problem is a disagreement, the tempo might be fast and tense, the dynamics might be loud, and the sounds might be sharp and clashing (like hitting a woodblock).

*The Action*

- Prompt students to focus on the middle of the story, and call their attention to the action taken to solve the problem. 
- Ask what musical elements could be used to show this action, and guide the class to brainstorm sounds.
  - For example, the tempo might become steady and purposeful, the dynamics might be strong and confident, and the sounds might be a strong, rhythmic beat from a drum.

*The Solution*

- Prompt students to focus on the end of the story, and call their attention to the solution, and a feeling of peace and justice. 
- Ask what musical elements could be used to show the solution, and guide the class to brainstorm sounds.
  - For example, the tempo might become slow and peaceful, the dynamics might be soft and gentle, and the sounds might be calm and harmonious, like a gentle shake from a shaker.

Write these ideas on the whiteboard/large paper, creating a simple musical map that the whole class can view.

**Our Musical Map Performance**
Now, the class will work in three separate groups to create three different sections of a song, based on the musical map.
Split the class into three groups, and assign them each a section of the map they created:

- *Group 1, The Problem:* This group will be in charge of the opening section of the song. Based on the brainstormed problem section of the musical map, they will use their instruments and/or body percussion to create a short, musical piece that sounds tense, chaotic, or sad.
- *Group 2, The Action:* This group will be in charge of the middle section of the song. Based on the brainstormed action section, they will create a short piece that sounds strong, purposeful, and determined.
- *Group 3, The Solution:* This group will be in charge of the final selection of the song. Based on the brainstormed solution section, they will create a short piece that sounds peaceful, calm, and hopeful.

Give the groups about 5-8 minutes (or more, depending on how you’ve organized this lesson) to create their parts and practice as a group.

Circulate and offer guidance, helping them to use their instruments and boies to create the sounds they want.

Once all the groups have practiced their sections, bring them all together, while still maintaining each group separately. 

Have each of the three groups perform their section, one after the other. This gives everyone a chance to hear the different musical “voices” and ideas. Encourage students to listen respectfully to each other’s work, paying attention to the unique rhythms and sounds each group created. This initial share is a moment to appreciate each part’s contribution to the whole story.

Next, it’s time to build the bridges between the sections. As a class, discuss how to transition smoothly from one part to the next. The Problem → The Action → The Solution.

- For example, to transition from the chaotic problem to the purposeful action, a suggestion might be a slow, deliberate stomp from the whole class, or a single, unifying drum beat.
- To transition from the determined action to the peaceful solution, perhaps a gentle, fading sound like a soft shaker, or a quiet, collective sigh.

The entire class will practice these transitions together, reinforcing the idea that everyone has a part to play in connecting the different phases of the story.

Guide the class through a full run-through of the entire composition, from beginning to end. Use clear hand signals to cue each group to begin and end their section and to guide the transitions. Use your hands to control the dynamics (loudness or softness) and tempo (speed), shaping the performance to be as expressive as possible. After one or two rehearsals, the class will perform the song one last time as a final, powerful piece.

This collaborative effort demonstrates that when we all work together, we can create something beautiful and impactful.
** A Musical Gallery Walk**

After the final performance as a class, have a short, information “gallery walk” where students can walk around and speak to their peers about their experience.

Open the discussion with guiding questions and prompts like:

- What was it like to create a story with sound and rhythm?
- How did the music make you feel during the problem part of the story? What about the solution part?
- What did you learn about the importance of everyone’s part in creating the whole song?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the process of musical mapping help you understand the big ideas of peace and justice? 
- What did you learn about how music can make you feel something about a story?
- What did you learn about the importance of working together to solve a problem?
- How did the class working together to create a song feel like a community working together to make a difference?
- What is one thing you can do to help make your classroom or community a more fair and peaceful place?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, story discussion, collaborative musical mapping and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., peace, justice, fairness) as demonstrated through the choices for musical parameters (tempo, dynamics, sounds) that directly reflect narrative elements and themes.
- Originality and thoughtfulness in translating non-musical concepts into specific, effective musical parameters for the map.
- How clearly and powerfully the musical performance communicated its intended message. Did the students’ performances successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the story?
- Ability to work effectively as a class, contributing ideas for the musical map, listening to and building upon classmates’ suggestions, and engaging respectfully during the AI exploration and discussion.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for social justice and the complexities of achieving peace and fairness.

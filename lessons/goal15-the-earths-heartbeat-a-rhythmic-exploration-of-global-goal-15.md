**Introduction**

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of these ecosystems for life on Earth and the interconnectedness of all living things.

Briefly review the key themes of  Global Goal 15:

- The diversity of life on land.
  - Global Goal 15 is all about the incredible variety of life we find on land. Towering trees in a rainforest, tiny insects in the soil, powerful animals roaming grasslands.
- The importance of healthy ecosystems.
  - These ecosystems aren’t just beautiful, they are essential. They provide us with clean air and water, food and materials. They help regulate our climate and protect us from disasters.
- The threats to these ecosystems.
  - Unfortunately, human activities are putting these ecosystems at risk. We’re losing forests, degrading land, and causing species to go extinct.
- The need for conservation and sustainable practices.
  - Global Goal 15 is a call to action. We need to protect these ecosystems, use them sustainably, and find ways to restore the damage we’ve caused.

Facilitate a brief class discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are some of the sounds you associate with different ecosystems (e.g., forest, grassland, etc.)?
- How can these sounds be translated into rhythmic patterns?
- How can we use rhythm to represent the interconnectedness of life on land?

Introduce and explain the concept of –Rhythm Telephone–

- Rhythm Telephone is a musical game where a rhythmic pattern is passed from person to person in a circle or a line.
- The rist person creates a short rhythmic pattern, and the next person repeats it.  Then, that person passes it on to the next, and so on.
- The challenge is to keep the rhythm accurate as it travels around the group.

Demonstrate a simple example:

- (Clap, snap, stomp) - (Clap, clap) - (Snap)

Emphasize the importance of:

- Listening carefully.
- Repeating the rhythm accurately.
- Maintaining the rhythm’s timing and feel.

**Rhythm Telephone Exploration**

Begin by creating a short rhythmic pattern related to a specific aspect of Global Goal 15.

Examples:

- *Forest Growth (relates to Target 15.2):* A slow, steady rhythm that gradually increases in complexity.
- *Deforestation (relates to Targets 15.2 and 15.9):* A sharp, repetitive rhythm with sudden pauses.
- *Desertification (relates to Target 15.3):* A dry, sparse rhythm with a feeling of emptiness.
- *Animal Movement (relates to Target 15.5):* A rhythmic pattern that mimics the gait of a particular animal.

The class forms a large circle. Demonstrate the initial rhythm clearly.

The rhythm is passed around the circle, one person at a time.

Encourage students to:

- Listen carefully to the rhythm they receive.
- Repeat it accurately, maintaining the tempo and feel.
- Pass it on clearly to the next person.

Observe and provide gentle guidance. Examples:

- Listen closely to the accents.
- Try to keep the rhythm steady.
- Use your whole body to express the rhythm.

Variations and Complexity: After a few rounds, variations can be introduced if students need an extra challenge.

- *Layering:* Have students add their own rhythmic layer on top of the original rhythm.
- *Call and Response:* Have students create short rhythmic phrases that ‘call’ and ‘respond’ to each other.

Encourage students and call on them to take turns creating the initial rhythm, connecting it to a specific aspect of Global Goal 15.\
Give students prompts if needed to help create their rhythms connected to Global Goal 15.

Examples:

- Create a rhythm that represents the energy of a healthy forest.
- Invent a rhythmic pattern that captures the feeling of soil being eroded by wind.
- Design a rhythm that mimics the movement of a herd of animals.
- Create a rhythmic sequence that symbolizes the process of deforestation.
- Develop a rhythm that represents the sounds of a wetland.
- Create a rhythmic that represents the diversity of sounds in a rainforest.
- Invent a rhythmic pattern that mimics the movement of a specific animal (e.g., a bird, a snake, an insect).
- Design a rhythm that captures the fragility of an endangered species.
- Create a rhythm that sounds like a chainsaw cutting down a tree.
- Invent a rhythm that represents the collapse of a tree.
- Design a rhythm that symbolizes the silence after a forest has been cleared.
- Create a rhythm that represents the wind blowing across a dry landscape.
- Invent a rhythmic pattern that mimics the cracking of dry earth.
- Design a rhythm that captures the scarcity of life in a desert.
- Create a rhythm that represents the planting of a seed and its growth.
- Invent a rhythmic pattern that symbolizes the flow of water in a healthy ecosystem.
- Design a rhythm that shows humans working in harmony with nature.
- Create a rhythm that conveys the urgency of protecting our planet.
- Invent a rhythmic pattern that represents people working together to solve an environmental problem.
- Design a rhythm that inspires action and hope for the future.

**Whole-Class Rhythmic Composition**

Guide the class in combining the different rhythmic elements into a collaborative composition.

You can:

- Direct the order in which different rhythms are played.
- Control the tempo and dynamics (loudness/softness).
- Encourage students to listen carefully to each other and create a cohesive piece.
- Incorporate optional nature sounds (made by the students) to enhance the atmosphere and the fun.

The goal is to create a dynamic and expressive musical piece that reflects the interconnectedness and complexity of life on land.


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the –Rhythm Telephone– activity - passing and transforming rhythms - help you understand the interconnectedness of different elements within terrestrial ecosystems?
- What did you learn about the power of rhythm and sound to represent abstract concepts like forest growth, desertification, or biodiversity loss?
- Did the process of creating and listening to the rhythmic chain make you think differently about the flow of energy and life across land-based environments?
- What did you discover about the effectiveness of simple rhythmic patterns in communicating complex ecological stories/
- How can music and sound help us to visualize and empathize with the “voice” of nature or the challenges it faces?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 15 and the importance of protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems through this musical exploration?
- How did the diverse rhythms created by the class highlight the many different facets of life on land (e.g., healthy ecosystems, threats like deforestation, the need for conservation)?
- Did a specific rhythmic sequence or the way it transformed within the “chain” make you think differently about a challenge or opportunity in your own local environment or globally related to Global Goal 15?
- What common themes or powerful messages about terrestrial ecosystems and human impact emerged across the different rhythms you heard?
- How does a rhythmic understanding of life on land relate to the broader goals of a sustainable future?
- Did creating or observing the rhythmic patterns spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with nature or local ecosystems?
- What emotions idd you connect with udring this musical activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action for life on land?
- What is one key takeaway about terrestrial ecosystems and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- What is one specific action, big or small, that you feel inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to achieving Global Goal 15?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to rhythm telephone, rhythmic exploration rounds, collective rhythm creation, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 themes (e.g., deforestation, desertification, biodiversity, conservation) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in rhythm and sound and verbal explanations during discussion.
- Originality and effectiveness in creating and transforming rhythmic patterns using body percussion or available instruments to represent various aspects of life on land.
- How clearly and powerfully the rhythmic contributions communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 15. Did the rhythmic expressions successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the land?
- Ability to work effectively as a class, demonstrating active listening when receiving rhythms, accurate repetition when passing them, and creative responsiveness during variations and layered compositions.
- Willingness and ability to maintain a steady beat, execute rhythmic patterns with reasonable precision, and blend sounds effectively within the ensemble, demonstrating musical awareness.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of music in advocating for environmental change and the complexities of conserving life on land.

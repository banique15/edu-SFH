**Introduction**  
Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 9, Industry, Innovation, and infrastructure.  
Clarify that Global Goal 9 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to help communities and countries build strong, lasting things (like safe roads, schools, and hospitals) \- that’s infrastructure. Emphasize it’s also about new ideas and inventions that make life better \- that’s innovation. And it’s about making sure industries (where things are made) are fair and sustainable, helping everyone grow \- that’s industry. Basically, it’s about building a better, smarter world for everyone.  
Introduce the concept of mirroring. Explain that mirroring in movement and dance is when two or more people move in sync with each other, reflecting each other’s movements just like a mirror. Clarify that it requires focusing on your partner, observing closely, and communicating without words. Tell students that mirroring helps build trust and understanding, and it’s a great way to show how different ideas or people can work together to build something amazing.  
**Warm Up: Build a Movement Chain**  
Explain that the class will play Build a Movement Chain to warm up their bodies and get ready for building ideas with movement and mirroring.   
Instruct students to stand in a circle.  
*Starting the Build.*

* Begin by performing one simple, clear movement (e.g., a gentle sway, a slow arm circle, a small knee bend).

*Mirror and Add*

* Instruct the student next to you to mirror the exact movement. Then, after mirroring, add their own new simple movement to it.   
* Then, the next student in the circle mirrors the new combination (first movement \+ second), then adds their own simple movement.  
  Example Sequence  
  * *Leader:* Gentle sway.  
  * *Student 1:* Gentle sway (mirrored) → slow arm circle.  
  * *Student 2:* Gentle sway, slow arm circle (mirrored) → small knee bend.  
  * *Student 3:* Gentle sway, slow arm circle, small knee bend (mirrored) → quick head turn.  
* Guide the chain of movements around the circle, building a longer, more complex movement sequence as it passes. Encourage students to keep the movements simple enough for others to follow.

*Collective Machine*

* After the chain has gone around 1-3 times, instruct everyone to perform the final, longest movement sequence together in unison. This creates a collective “machine” of movement.

Conclude warm up by affirming their focus, memory, and ability to build together through movement, skills vital for mirroring.  
**Exploring Mirroring Techniques**  
Explain that students will explore different ways to mirror, just like building different parts of a structure.  
*Basic Mirroring*

* Instruct students to pair up and face each other. Explain that one student will be the leader, initiating movements, and the other will be the follower, mirroring them as closely as possible.  
* Encourage students to start with slow, clear, simple movements.  
* Play calm, flowing music.   
  Examples  
  * [*Ambient 1: Music for Airports*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwYtllyt3Q), Brian Eno  
  * [“Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune” (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7loz-HWUM), Claude Debussy  
  * “[Gnossiene No. 1”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PErbSeBCjdY), Erik Satie  
  * [“Fantasia on a Theme”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6pEIHtffqQ), Thomas Tallis  
  * [“Pavane”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpgyTl8yqbw) Op. 50, Gabriel Fauré  
  * [“Nimrod”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhnMd1Jl7SA) (from Enigma Variations), Edward Elgar  
  * [“Nuvole Bianche”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR2W2scFS4Y), Ludovico Einaudi  
  * [“Tessellate”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geSScmBWBtE), Ellie Goulding (Alt-J cover)  
* Instruct students to focus on clarity, precision, and nonverbal communication.  
* After a few minutes, instruct partners to switch roles.

After both partners have led/followed, discuss, asking guiding questions like:

* How did it feel to lead?  
* Was it challenging to make your movements clear?  
* How did it feel to follow?  
* What did you focus on to match your partner?

*Mirroring with Variations: Building Connections*

* Introduce variations to build on the basic mirroring skills.  
  * *Changing Speed:* Instruct leaders to try moving very slowly, then very quickly.  
    * Ask followers: How does it feel to match a fast movement? A slow one?  
  * *Changing Levels:* Instruct leaders to explore high (reaching up) medium (standing), and low (crouching down) movements.  
    * Ask followers: How does mirroring different levels change your movement?  
  * *Adding Feelings:* Instruct leaders to show a feeling with their movement (e.g., excited, strong, worried).   
    * Ask followers: Did you feel the emotion your partner was showing? How did your body reflect it?  
  * *Switching Roles Mid-Mirror:* Challenge pairs to switch who is leading and who is following without stopping the movement. One partner simply takes over the lead. Explain that this shows how easily people can collaborate and share leadership in a project.

When finished, discuss, asking guiding questions like:

* How did these variations make mirroring more interesting?  
* How did mirroring help you understand your partner’s movements and feelings?

Explain that these mirroring skills help us understand others and work together, just like people do when building new things or creating new ideas.  
**Innovation Blueprint Challenge**  
Explain to the class that they will brainstorm ideas for their upcoming final mirroring pieces. Divide students into pairs (or utilize the pre-existing pairs). Provide each student with a piece of paper and writing utensil.  
*Sketch an Idea*

* Instruct each student to quickly draw a very simple “blueprint” or sketch of one new invention or strong structure related to Global Goal 9 (e.g., a super fast train, a giant recycling machine, a new kind of school, a strong bridge, a robot helper, etc.).

*Create a Key Movement*

* Instruct each student to think about their drawing and create one key movement or gesture that captures the essence of their invention or structure (e.g., a swift smooth gesture for the train, a strong steady pose for the bridge, a repeating whirring movement for the recycling machine).

*Mirror the Blueprint*

* Instruct pairs to share their drawings with their partner. Then, one partner performs their key movement, while the other partner mirrors it. Repeat for the second partner’s idea.

*Discuss and Choose*

* After mirroring, each pair discusses which of their ideas (or a combination) they want to focus on for their collaborative mirroring piece.

Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:

* How does your movement show the strength of your bridge?  
* Can you partner clearly mirror your robot helper gesture?  
* Which idea makes the best movement story for mirroring?

**Mirroring Innovation: Creating Movement Pieces**  
Explain that each pair will now create a short (45-60 second) mirroring movement piece that tells a story about Industry, Innovation, or Infrastructure from Global Goal 9, using the skills practiced and the brainstormed ideas.  
Instruct pairs to choose a central idea for their piece (e.g., building a strong bridge, a new invention being created, people working together fairly).  
Encourage pairs to include:

* *Clear Leader/Follower:* Start with a clear leader, then maybe switch roles smoothly in hte middle.  
* *Dynamic Changes:* Go from slow to fast, soft to strong, or use different levels to show parts of the story.  
* *Symbolic Movements:* Use movements from the brainstorm (or new ones) that represent building, inventing, growth, or solving a problem.  
* *The Power of Connection:* Show how the mirroring itself emphasizes teamwork and understanding.

Play varied music during creation time that is upbeat and empowering. Music examples:

* [Hip Hop Instrumentals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3jjH-_LVG4&list=PLrgkRQ9954-Rv7gNesYeAzmjwzuBbkM47&index=1)  
* [Upbeat Instrumental Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIu4vp_PuXU) Playlist  
* [Cheerful Instrumental Bops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs-aqFcAOQk) Playlist

Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:

* How can your mirroring show the strength of a new building?   
* Can you have one partner show a problem and the other mirror a solution?  
* Are you listening and responding to each other’s movements?

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did the practice of mirroring (reflecting another person’s movements) help you understand the concept of collaboration and interconnectedness that is central to Global Goal 9?  
* What did you learn about non-verbal communication and empathy through mirroring? How might these skills be important in building global partnerships for innovation and infrastructure?  
* What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 9 and the importance of industry, innovation, and infrastructure through the movement exploration?  
* What role do you think shared understanding and aligned actions (like in mirroring) play in achieving sustainable industrialization or resilient infrastructure?  
* Hoe did connecting to abstract concepts (like innovation or infrastructure) help you to see the human element within the goals of industry, innovation, and infrastructure?  
* What are some ways that you can continue to use movement, dance, or collaborative thinking to raise awareness or advocate for Global Goal 9 in your daily life?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, mirroring exercises, creative movement, and class discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concept of industry, innovation, and infrastructure (building, new ideas, fair industry), as demonstrated through the symbolism and intention within the movement pieces and verbal explanations during sharing and discussion.  
* Originality and effectiveness in using mirroring techniques (e.g., precise reflection, leading/following variations, incorporating levels/qualities) to convey the chosen message about industry, innovation, and/or infrastructure. Look for clear expression of ideas through the movement.  
* Ability to work effectively with partners, demonstrating active listening, responsiveness, and mutual support during the mirroring and creative movement phases.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

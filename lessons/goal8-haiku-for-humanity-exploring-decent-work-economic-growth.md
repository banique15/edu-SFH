**Introduction**  
	Start with a thought-provoking question:

* If you could describe your ideal job in one word, what would it be?

	Have students share their answers and briefly discuss their dream careers.  
	Introduce Global Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth if necessary.  
**Haiku Exploration**  
	Explain the form; define haiku poetry, emphasizing its 5-7-5 syllable structure and its origins in Japanese literature. Explain how haiku traditionally focuses on nature but can be adapted to explore other themes.  
		Haiku poetry is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that is renowned for its brevity and elegance. It's a three-line poem with a strict syllable count: 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third. This 5-7-5 structure creates a concise and focused expression, often capturing a moment or observation.  
		Haiku originated in Japan centuries ago, evolving from a collaborative linked-verse form called *renga*. The opening stanza of a renga was called a *hokku*, which eventually developed into the standalone haiku we know today.  
		While haiku traditionally focuses on nature and the changing seasons, modern haiku poets often explore a wider range of subjects, including emotions, social issues, and even abstract concepts. The essence of haiku lies in its ability to convey a deep meaning or feeling within its compact form.  
	*Model Haiku*: Present some haiku examples related to Global Goal 8's targets.

* **Target 8.1** *(Sustain per captia economic growth):* Growth lifts the nation, Income rises year by year, Lives are improved now.  
* **Target 8.2** *(Achieve higher levels of economic productivity):* New tech skills advance, Output soars efficiency, Prosperity blooms.

* **Target 8.5** *(Achieve full and productive employment):* Equal pay for work, Opportunities for all souls, No one left behind.  
* **Target 8.6** *(Substantially reduce youth unemployment):* Youth trained skills honed, Ready for the workforce now, Futures bright and bold.  
* **Target 8.7** *(Eradicate forced labor and child labor):* No child in the mines, Education sets them free, Childhood protected.  
* **Target 8.8** *(Protect labor rights):* Safe work fair treatment, Workers' rights defended strong, Dignity for all.

**Connecting Haiku to Global Goal 8**  
	Divide students into small groups.  
	Assign each group a specific target from Global Goal 8 (or allow them to choose on that interests them). Have the group discuss the target, focusing on what it means in practical terms.  
	Ask open-ended questions to stimulate discussion.

* Why do you think this target is important?  
* What are some of the challenges in achieving this target?  
* How  might this target affect people in different parts of the world?  
* What can we do to contribute to this target?

	Facilitate collaborative learning by encouraging students to share their ideas and perspectives within their groups.  
	Guide each student to write at least two haiku poems inspired by their group's target (ensure each haiku is on its own piece of paper). Encourage them to use vivid language and imagery to capture the essence of the target.  
	To help students craft meaningful haiku, you can offer guidance if needed, including the following:

* *Brainstorming:* Before writing, have students brainstorm words, phrases, and images related to their target. Encourage them to think about the people, places, and actions involved.  
* *Sensory details:* Remind students to use sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to bring their haiku to life. For example, instead of saying "factory," they could say "clanging metal" or "spinning wheels."  
* *Figurative Language:* Encourage the use of metaphors, similies, and personification to create vivid imagery.  
* *Show, don't tell:* Guide students to "show" the essence of their target through concrete images rather than simply stating facts.  
* *Structure and Syllables:* Reiterate the 5-7-5 syllable structure and provide tools (like online syllable counters) if needed.  
* *Revision and refinement:* Encourage students to revise their haiku, focusing on word choice, imagery, and the overall impact of their poem.

**Gallery Walk**  
	Have students post their haiku around the classroom, on the walls or on tables/desks.  
	Clearly explain the purpose and process of the gallery walk. Emphasize that it's an opportunity to appreciate each other's work, share positive feedback, and gain different perspectives on Global Goal 8\.  
	Begin the gallery walk with a few minutes of silent observation. This allows students to independently read and reflect on the haiku without distraction.  
	Allow students to give thoughtful feedback, either verbally in the moment or by providing them with small slips of paper to write comments on. Encourage students to give specific and constructive feedback, focusing on imagery and language, connection to the target, and emotional impact.  
	Remind students to be respectful of each other's work and to offer feedback in a positive and encouraging manner.  
	To facilitate the experience:

* *Circulate and observe:* Walk around the classroom during the gallery walk, observing the student interactions and offering support as needed.  
* *Time management:* Provide a clear timeframe for the gallery walk to ensure that students have enough time to ready and respond to a number of the poems.



**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did writing haiku help you understand the complexities of decent work and economic growth?  
* What new insights did you gain about the importance of decent work and economic growth for all?  
* What challenges did you encounter while trying to express these complex ideas in the concise form of haiku?  
* How can poetry be a tool for raising awareness about social issues like those addressed in Global Goal 8?  
* Which haiku resonated with you the most and why? Did any of your classmates' haiku surprise you or give you a new perspective?  
* How did you feel about using your writing to advocate for a cause you care about?  
* What role can you play in promoting fair labor practices and economic justice?  
* Did this experience change your perspective on the power of individual voices and collective action?  
* What specific actions or changes are you inspired to make in your own life or community as a result of this project?  
* In what other areas of your life could you apply the skills you developed in this lesson (creative writing, persuasive writing, critical thinking, collaboration)?  
* How has this activity impacted your understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to decent work, economic growth, and global development?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial brainstorming, understanding haiku structure, individual haiku writing, and active participation in the gallery walk and discussions.   
* Comprehension of Global Goal 8 and its targets and core concepts (e.g., fair wages, safe conditions, youth employment, sustainable growth). This will be evidenced through the thematic content and precise imagery within the haiku poems and verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effectiveness in crafting haiku poems that adhere to the 5-7-5 syllable structure while still conveying a meaningful message about decent work and economic growth.  
* How clearly and powerfully the haiku communicates its intended message about Global Goal 8\. Did the concise form successfully evoke thought or emotion in the reader/listener?  
* Quality of the writing craft, including word choice, vivid imagery, and the conciseness of the language within the haiku format.  
* Ability to articulate personal artistic choices and to interpret and provide thoughtful feedback on classmates' haiku, connecting them to Global Goal 8 themes.  
* Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of concise poetry in advocating for social justice and economic wellbeing.

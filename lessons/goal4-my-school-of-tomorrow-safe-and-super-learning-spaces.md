## **My School of Tomorrow: Safe and Super Learning Spaces**  
**Materials**  
Large sheets of drawing paper paper or cardstock (one per student)  
Variety of art supplies:  
	Markers, paints, colored pencils, crayons, paints, etc.  
	Collage materials: magazines, newspapers, recycled materials  
Scissors and glue  
Whiteboard or large chart paper  
Markers  
Notebooks or Paper  
Pens/Pencils  
\[Optional\] A few simple, inspiring images or short video clips of modern, innovative, or futuristic buildings (not necessarily schools), focusing on interesting shapes, materials, or ways they interact with nature.  
**Introduction**  
Begin by introducing Global Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

* Emphasize that this means ensuring everyone, everywhere, has a chance to get a great education by going to good schools, learning important and interesting things, and getting ready for the future, from little kids to grown-ups.

Discuss how today, the class will focus on a very important part of quality education: having safe, welcoming, and amazing places for everyone to learn. Connect this to Target 4.a by explaining this means a school where:

* You feel totally safe and secure, like no one will bully you.  
* Everyone feels welcome and included, no matter who they are or what they need.  
* The classrooms and spaces make learning exciting and fun.  
* Every student feels comfortable and ready to learn.

Tell them that tooday, the class will be looking to the future, designing our very own School of Tomorrow, a school that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive for all learners.  
**Dream School Feature Flash**  
Begin with a quick imagination-sparking warm-up to get brains ready.

* Instruct students that when you say "Go\!", they should quickly think of one exciting thing they would want in their School of Tomorrow that makes it safe, welcoming, or fun for learning. This can be realistic, futuristic, or completely made up. Encourage them to use their imaginations. They can draw a quick picture on their paper or just think or whisper the idea to themselves.

Make sure students know these can be realistic, or something fantastical, have them use their imaginations.  
Continue this for a few rounds. Examples:

* *Round 1, Safety:* What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make it feel super safe? Go\!  
  * E.g., Force fields around the school, quiet zones for focusing, anti-bullying robots, soft landing floors, comfortable seating, calm-down corners, sensors that detect sadness, doors that know who belong, safe play areas, bright lights at night, friendly crossing guards who are always there.  
* *Round 2, Welcoming:* What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make it feel welcoming and inclusive for everyone/ Go\!  
  * E.g., rainbow hallways, comfy beanbag chairs, a kindness robot, a buddy bench, rooms with different light/sound levels, personalized lockers, quiet study spots, community spaces, signs in many languages, diverse art on walls, ramps for wheelchairs, sensory spaces, places to rest quietly, big smiles at the door.  
* *Round 3, Learning Feature:* What would you want in your School of Tomorrow to make learning fun and engaging for everyone? Go\!  
  * E.g., Hologram teachers, outdoor adventure classrooms, flying desks, robots that help with homework, immersive VR learning, art studios everywhere, edible gardens, a giant slide in every classroom, a science lab that smells like cookies, rooms that change color/temperature to help you focus, a music room where instruments float, discovery zones.

After each round, invite a few students to quickly share their ideas. Affirm their thinking, noting that these ideas will be perfect for a School of Tomorrow.  
**Designing Our School of Tomorrow**  
Explain that the class will take these ideas to brainstorm for our School of Tomorrow by listing and sketching ideas on the whiteboard for what makes a school safe, welcoming, and fun for learning.  
Draw three main sections on the whiteboard:

* *Safe Spaces (Write all ideas using one color marker e.g., blue)*  
  * Ask: What would you see or imagine in a school of tomorrow that makes every student feel super safe and protected from harm or bullying?  
  * Examples: Quiet zones, soft play areas, friendly security robots, calming sensory rooms, clear rules shown with pictures, places to talk to a trusted result easily, well-lit hallways, clear pathways for everyone, safe entryways, calm-down corners, anti-bullying alarms, friendly faces, spaces for quiet reflection.  
* *Welcoming Spaces (Write ideas using one color marker e.g. green)*  
  * Ask: What design ideas would make everyone feel welcome and included in this school of the future, no matter who they are, what language they speak, or what their needs are?  
  * Examples: Universal restrooms, calming corners, ramps for wheelchairs, signs in many languages, diverse art on walls, comfortable seating for all body types, sunny gathering spots, bright inviting colors, flexible furniture, quiet areas, busy areas, outdoor spaces, buddy benches, rooms that adjust to light/sound needs, places to share cultures and ideas.  
* *Fun Learning Spaces (Write all in one color e.g. purple)*  
  * Ask: What amazing places or features would make learning incredibly fun, exciting, and effective for every single student in this school of tomorrow?  
  * Examples: Outdoor classrooms, science labs with living plants, art rooms with endless supplies, virtual reality learning zones, edible gardens, flexible seating, quiet nooks for reading, loud spaces for group projects, giant whiteboards everywhere, building zones, music rooms with floating instruments, rooms that change color/temperature to help you focus, discovery zones, a slide between floors, classrooms in space, rooms that can fly.

Summarize by by explaining that these ideas are the tools they will use to design their very own school of tomorrow.  
**Futuristic Art Inspiration**  
Explain that artists have always imagined the future and that students will look at some cool artworks that show futuristic buildings or imaginative places.  
Instruct them to think about how these artists made things look futuristic, and how students can use those ideas in their own school designs.  
Show selected visual aids. Examples:

Facilitate a discussion using guiding questions like:

* What shapes do you see in these artworks? Are they round, pointy, zig-zaggy? How do those shapes make the building look exciting or fast?  
* What colors did the artists use? Do they look bright, shiny, or mysterious?  
* Do these buildings look like they're moving or changing? How do the lines make it feel busy or energetic?  
* What elements in these pictures make them feel like they're from the future, or from a different world?  
* How could you use a sharp, pointy shape from this art to show a fast learning slide in your school? Or a curvy line to show a comfy reading nook?

**My School of Tomorrow Artwork**  
Give each student a large sheet of drawing paper.  
Explain that students will now use their imagination and the brainstorm ideas on the board, plus inspiration from the futuristic art they saw, to create an arftwork of their own School of Tomorrow.  
Instruct them to show what their ideal school looks like, focusing on how it is safe, welcoming, and helps everyone learn.  
Encourage students to:

* *Draw, paint, or collage:* Use any art materials they choose (any that are available in the classroom).  
* *Design a building or a classroom:* They can design the whole school from the outside, or show what one amazing classroom looks like inside.  
* *Show features from the brainstorm:* Include things that make it safe (e.g., calm spots), welcoming (e.g., ramps, diverse art), and fun for learning (e.g., outdoor labs, VR zones).  
* *Use colors and shapes:* How do colors make a space feel safe or exciting? What shapes make a building look new and modern?  
* *Experiment with lines:* Can they use straight, sharp lines lik esome futuristic art, or flowing curvy lines?

Circulate, offering support and encouraging experimentation. Ask guiding questions like:

* How are you showing that your school is safe from bullying?  
* What elements in your design make it welcoming for every student?  
* Can you add something that makes learning super fun and engaging for everyone?  
* What colors make your School of Tomorrow feel positive and ready for learning?  
* Are you thinking about how the light might make your school feel more welcoming?  
* How could you use a zig-zag line to show an exciting learning path in your school or classroom?

**My School of Tomorrow Statement**  
Have students write a short statement on the back of their artwork. 

* Prompt students to describe their vision if needed: "My atwork shows \[what was designed\]. My school/classroom is safe because \[one way\]. It is welcoming because \[one way\]. It is great for learning because \[one way\].

Instruct them to give their artwork a creative title.  
Have students share their School of Tomorrow with the class, either going around the classroom or asking for volunteers to share. Allow for questions from students if desired.

**Reflection & Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did designing your School of Tomorrow help you think about what makes a great education for everyone?  
* What did you learn about the importance of schools being safe, welcoming, and fun places to learn?  
* Which designs from your classmates made you think it was a great idea for a school? Why?  
* What does our School of Tomorrow activity tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 4: Quality Education?  
* What's one small thing you can do this week to make your own classroom or school a more safe, welcoming, or fun place to learn?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm-up, brainstorm, artwork creation, and class discussions.  
* Understanding of the core concept of safe and inclusive learning environments within Global Goal 4, as demonstrated through artwork design and verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effort in creating the School of Tomorrow artwork. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 4 (does the artwork clearly represent features that make a school safe, welcoming, and effective for learning for all?), and use of elements (are there attempts to use colors, shapes, and features to convey the vision of a futuristic/ideal school, potentially inspired by the artists shown?).  
* Thoughtfulness of the brief My School of Tomorrow statement, showing a connection between the design and the goal.  
* Ability to articulate learning and personal connecgtions during the reflection and summary discussion.

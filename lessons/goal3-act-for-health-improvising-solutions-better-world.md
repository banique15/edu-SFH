## **Act for Health: Improvising Solutions for a Better World**  
**(30-60 MINUTES)**  
**Materials**  
Open space for movement and improvisation  
Props: Simple objects to represent medical tools, environmental hazards, etc.  
Whiteboard or large chart paper  
Markers  
Notebooks or Paper  
Pens/Pencils  
**Introduction**  
	Begin by having students stand in a circle. Explain that rhythm is a fundamental part of life, found in our heartbeat, the cycles of nature, and even our daily routines. Today, as a warm up, they will explore rhythm and improvisation through body percussion.  
	Guide students to start with a simple, steady beat by clapping their hands. Then, encourage them to experiment with other sounds, like snapping fingers, stomping feet, patting their legs, or even vocalizations.  
	Choose one student to be the "conductor." They can change the rhythm, add new sounds, or introduce simple movements that the rest of the group follows. Switch leaders every 30 seconds or so, giving multiple students a chance to lead.  
	After the activity, facilitate a discussion about the connection between rhythm and health:

* *Physical Health:* How did moving your body and keeping the rhythm make you feel? Did it increase your heart rate or energy levels?  
* *Mental and Emotional Health:* How did focusing on the rhythm and coordinating with others affect your concentration and mood? Did it create a sense of connection or joy?  
* *Balance and Well Being:* How can finding a healthy rhythm in our daily lives contribute to our overall well being? What are some examples of healthy rhythms (regular sleep, exercise, balanced meals, etc.)?

**Scene Starters: The Challenge**  
	Divide students into groups of 3-4. Each group will receive a Global Goal 3 Target.  
	Provide each group with scenario prompts related to their target. Examples:

	Groups have 5-10 minutes to create a short scene based on their prompt, with no pre-planning.

* Have students focus on portraying the emotions and challenges of the situation.

**Scene Reversal: The Solution**  
	Each group keeps their original scenario **but** is now tasked with improvising a scene wher ethe situation is **improved,** or solutions are being implemented.  
	Solutions can be real or imaginative, from medical advances to community support systems to policy changes. Examples:

* *Individual Actions*  
  * Healthy lifestyle choices  
  * Seeking help when needed  
  * Volunteering in the community

Groups share new scenes. Open a class discussion. Example questions:

* How did the mood shift between scenes?  
* What solutions were presented? Are they feasible in the real world?  
* What obstacles might prevent those solutions?

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did physically improvising the challenges and solutions related to Global Goal 3 deepen your understanding of the issue?  
* What emotions did you connect with while portraying your character and the different scenarios?  
* Did the "scene reversal' activity \- moving from challenge to solution \- offer a sense of hope or agency in addressing these health issues?  
* How did the immediacy of improvisation help you connect with the human element of these global health concerns?  
* What did you learn about the power of storytelling and dramatic representation in raising awareness about health issues?  
* What were some of the most effective ways your group used character, setting, and action to communicate the chosen health challenge and potential solutions?  
* What role did creativity and spontaneity play in finding potential solutions during the improvisation process?  
* Did exploring these health challenges through drama spark any personal connections or reflections on your own health and wellbeing or the health of your community?  
* What did you learn about the importance of empathy and understanding when considering the health struggles of others?  
* What are some of the key takeaways from the different scenes presented today that you think are important for others to understand about Global Goal 3?

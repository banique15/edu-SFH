**Viewing**

Show the selected video(s) of Native American dances, allowing students time to engage with the dance/movement piece(s).

Before each video, provide cultural context (outlined above).

Adjust the level of guidance based on the students’ age and/or prior knowledge.


**Discussion**

- What did you observe in the movements of the dancers? How did their bodies move? What did you notice about their costumes or the setting?
- What emotions or ideas did the dance convey to you? What did it make you think about?
- How might the dance represent the people’s relationship with the land, animals, or natural forces?
- How does this dance connect to the themes of Global Goal 15 (e.g., respect for nature, sustainable use of resources, interconnectedness of ecosystems)?
- Can you connect any specific elements of the dance to a particular target within Global Goal 15? (this may be more appropriate for older students.)
- What can we learn from these dances about different ways of valuing and caring for the Earth?

Emphasize how dance and movement can be a powerful tool for expressing ideas, raising awareness, and inspiring action around environmental stewardship.

**Personal Connection**

Ask students to reflect on their own experiences with the environment (if any) and their connection to life on land. Ask questions like:

- What are some ways that you connect with nature in your own life (e.g., spending time in parks, hiking, observing animals)?
- Does your own culture have any dances or traditions that relate to nature or the land?
- What are some environmental issues that you are concerned about?
- What can we do in our own communities to show respect for the land and protect its resources?
- How can learning about other cultures’ relationships with the land broaden our understanding of environmental stewardship?

Encourage students to share their personal stories and connect them to themes explored in the dance/movement.

**Closing Activity Options**

- **One Word Summary:** Ask each student to think of one work encapsulating their biggest takeaway or feeling about nature or land stewardship after this dance/movement exploration. Have them share their word with the class, briefly explaining their choice. They can also express the word through a single, sustained movement. Bonus: Collect all the words to make a word cloud.
- **Quote Connection:** Share an inspiring quote about nature, land stewardship, or indigenous wisdom. Facilitate an open discussion about how this quote connects to the dance/movement and activity they experienced in class. *Example:* “The Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s needs, but not every man’s greed.” - Mahatma Gandhi  “We won’t have a society if we destroy the environment.” - Margaret Mead
- **Artwork Challenge:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to create a “flash land art” project using only recycled materials in 10 minutes. Encourage them to consider the challenges facing our Earth and potential solutions.
- **Movement Response:** Invite students to creat a short, simple movement sequence (individually or in small groups) inspired by one of the dances or Global Goal 15 in general. This is about personal expression, not imitation.
- **Creative Writing:** Have students write a short poem or paragraph inspired by one of the dances, focusing on the relationship between people and the land.
- **Visual Art Connection:** Have students create a quick sketch or image that comes to mind when they watched the dance, representing their connection to the themes of Life on Land.

NOTE:

In this lesson, cultural sensitivity is paramount.

- Emphasize that the dances are sacred and hold deep cultural meaning and significance.
- Avoid any suggestion of imitation or appropriation.
- Focus on learning from the values and perspectives expressed in the dances.

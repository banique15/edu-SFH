**Introduction**

Begin with a clear explanation of guided imagery.

Explain that it’s a technique where the facilitator uses descriptive language to guide participants to visualize specific scenarios, sensations, or emotions.

Emphaisze that the goal is to tap into the mind-body connection and explore these visualizations through movement.

Highlight that there are no “right” or “wrong” ways to move, and encourage students to interpret the imagery in their own way.

Lead a brief, simple guided imagery exercise to introduce the concept:

*Example:*

- Close your eyes and soften your gaze. Imagine you are standing in a forest. Feel the soft earth beneath your feet. Breathe in the fresh, clean air. Notice the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. Move as if you are a tree, swaying gently in the breeze. Reach your arms up towards the sky, like branches growing. Feel your roots grounding you to the earth.”

Facilitate a short discussion:

- What images came to mind during the exercise?
- How did the imagery influence your movement?
- How can guided imagery help us explore complex ideas and emotions?

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, and emphasize the urgency of addressing unsustainable consumption patterns and the need for a shift towards more sustainable practices.

Briefly review the key targets and indicators of Global Goal 12 if needed.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What are some of the biggest challenges related to consumption and production in our society?
- How does our individual consumption contribute to global issues?
- What are some examples of sustainable alternatives to current practices?

Engage students in a discussion about how guided imagery can be used to explore themes of consumption and production. Ask questions like:

- How can we use guided imagery to visualize the consequences of unsustainable practices?
- Can guided imagery help us embody the concept of a circular economy or sustainable lifestyle?
- How can movement be a powerful tool for expressing our concerns and hopes for a sustainable future?

**Guided Imagery and Movement Exploration**

Lead the students through a series of guided imagery exercises, each focusing on a specific aspect of Global Goal 12.

Provide clear and evocative instructions, encouraging students to interpret the imagery through movement.

Use a variety of movement qualities (e.g., flowing, sharp, fast, slow) and spatial patterns (e.g., circular, linear, expansive, contracted) to enhance the experience.

Incorporate elements of breathwork to connect movement with emotional expression.

Throughout the exercises, encourage students to:

- Listen to their bodies and move in a way that feels comfortable and expressive.
- Connect with the emotions and sensations evoked by the imagery.
- Explore different ways of interpreting the visualizations through movement.

**Creative Movement Exploration**

After the guided imagery sequences, facilitate a brief period of free movement exploration. Invite students to:

- Reflect on the images and sensations they experienced during the guided imagery.
- Explore their own movement responses to the themes of consumption and sustainability.
- Move in a way that feels authentic and expressive.

Provide prompts or suggestions if needed to guide the exploration:

- How would you move to represent the idea of excessive consumption?
- Can you show through movement the concept of reducing waste?
- How can you express your hope for a sustainable future through your body?

Lead a gentle cool-down to bring the energy back down and prepare for reflection.

Include stretching, deep breathing, and calming movements.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What was your experience with the guided imagery and movement exploration?
- What images or sensations were most powerful for you?
- How did the movement help you connect with the themes of Global Goal 12?
- What did you learn about your own relationship with consumption and sustainability?
- How can movement and creative expression be used to advocate for change?

## **Scripts for Equality: Crafting Dialogue for a Gender-Equal World**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials**

Paper or notebook

Pens/pencils

Images or videos related to gender equality

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

**Introduction**

Begin by asking students, “How can words create change?”

Re-introduce Global Goal 5 if needed - “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”

Connect to scriptwriting by explaining how dialogue in stories and plays can reveal characters’ perspectives, challenge societal norms, and spark conversations about important issues like gender equality.

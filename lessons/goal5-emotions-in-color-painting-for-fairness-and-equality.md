**Introduction**

Welcome students to an exciting art class. Explain that they will use their imaginations and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 5, Gender Equality, which aims to

make sure everyone - boys, girls, men, and women, have fair and equal chances in life. Emphasize that this means everyone gets to be treated with respect, has the same opportunities to learn and grow, and can feel strong and proud of who they are, no matter their gender. It’s about being fair to all!
Ask students ot think about how they express big feelings when words aren’t enough. Explain that art, especially a style called Expressionism, is a powerful way to show feelings and ideas directly. 
Explain that Expressionist artists cared more about showing how something feels inside than how it looks exactly on the outside. They used bold colors, strong lines, and sometimes even squiggly or distorted shapes to make you feel something when you look at their art.
Tell students that today, you all will explore what gender equality feels like, both when things are unfair and when they are strong and equal, using Expressionist art.

Show selected visual aids of Expressionist artworks.

Facilitate a discussion about the art. Ask guiding questions like:

- What colors do you see? Do they feel bright, dark, angry, or calm?
- What do you notice about the lines and shapes? Are they straight, curvy, sharp, or wavy? How do they make you feel?
- Does this artwork make you feel a strong emotion? What kind of feeling do you think the artist was trying to show?
- Does the art look exactly like real life, or is it a bit exaggerated? Why do you think the artist chose to draw/paint it that way?
- How do these artists use art to express a big feeling or idea?

**Warm Up: Feeling Lines & Colors**

Explain that they will explore how different lines and colors can show different feelings. Instruct students to take a piece of scrap paper and a marker or crayon.

*Phase 1: Line Emotions*

- When I say a feeling, quickly draw some lines on your paper that show that feeling. Don’t worry about drawing objects, just draw the lines.

`	`Examples:

- *Happy:* (e.g., bouncy, curving, wiggly lines, spirals).
- *Angry:* (e.g., sharp, jagged, zig-zag lines, dark, scribbled lines).
- *Calm:* (e.g., smooth, flowing, horizontal lines, gentle curves).
- *Excited:* (e.g., quick, energetic, bursting lines, stars, zig-zags).
- *Worried:* (e.g., squiggly, tangled, messy lines, lines that go in circles).
- *Strong:* (e.g., thick, straight, bold lines, solid shapes).

*Phase 2: Color Emotions*

- Choose one color that makes you feel [Happy/Angry/Calm/Strong/Etc.] and scribble that color onto your paper, thinking about how the color expresses that feeling. (Allow time for one or two examples).

Conclude the warm up by affirming their exploration, explaining that they will use these feeling lines and colors in their main art project.

**My Art of Fairness**

Explain: We’re going to create an Emotion Spectrum and Action Symbols map to brainstorm ideas for our Expressionist art about fairness and equality. We’ll think about how different feelings connect to these ideas, and what symbols or actions can show them.

On the board/large paper, draw a simple horizontal line labeled “Fairness Scale.” On one end, write “Unfair!”; on the other end, write “Fair and Equal!” In the middle, write “Working Towards It.”

- *Unfair! Emotions and Symbols*
  - Ask: What feelings come to mind when things are unfair or unequal? What symbols or actions could show those feelings or situations?

    Examples:

    - Sadness (slumped figure, gray/dark colors, teardrops), frustration (sharp lines, messy scribbles, clenched fists, red/orange colors), exclusion (a lone figure outside a group, a fence, a closed shape, muted colors), being told “no” unfairly (a big X, a blocked path, a frown, a heavy line), not being heard (a hand over a mouth, a small quiet shape, a muted color).
  - Write these ideas under “Unfair!”, drawing quick sketches of symbols.
- *Fair and Equal Emotions and Symbols*
  - Ask: What feelings come to mind when things are fair and equal, when everyone feels strong and respected? What symbols or colors could show those feelings or situations?

    Examples:

    - Joy (bright yellow, wide smiles, open arms, jumping figures, stars, sunbursts), strength (bold lines, upright figures, flexed muscles, a shield, a powerful stance, red/blue colors), inclusivity (many different colors/shapes blended together, a circle of people, open doors, connecting lines), being heard (an open mouth, a lightbuld, a microphone, a bright light, a straight line), opportunity (open doors, a path stretching far, a ladder, a growing plant, bright green/gold colors), respect (two hands shaking, bowing heads, calm faces, balanced shapes).
  - Write these ideas under “Fair and Equal!” drawing quick sketches of symbols.
- *Working Towards It Symbols*
  - Ask: What actions or symbols would show us working to change “Unfair!” into “Fair and Equal!”? What does progress look like?

    Examples:

    - Hands reaching out, people talking, a bridge, a path, growing plants, breaking chains, moving forward, a hand lifting another, a megaphone, a light getting brighter.

Summarize: This emotion spectrum gives us lots of bold feelings and symbols to use in our Expressionist art about gender equality!

**Expressive Creation: My Equality Art**

Give each student a large piece of paper/cardstock/canvas and access to art materials available.

Explain: Now, you will create your own Expressionist artwork about Global Goal 5: Gender Equality. You can choose to show a feeling about unfairness, or a feeling about fairness and strength, or even how we move from unfairness to fairness.

Encourage students to:

- *Use bold colors:* How do colors help show anger, joy, sadness, or strength?
- *Use strong lines and shapes:* How can sharp lines show frustration, and soft curves show peace? How can a big shape show strength, and a small shape show feeling left out?
- *Show feelings:* Remember, it’s about translating your feelings and ideas onto the paper, not drawing a perfect picture. Use the symbols and ideas from the brainstorm to help.
- *Experiment:* Try blending colors, making big brushstrokes, or using collage to add texture.

Circulate, offering support and encouraging experimentation. Ask guiding questions like:

- What feeling about fairness or unfairness are you showing with [this color/line/etc.]?
- How does the way you’re using your [brush/crayon/marker/etc.] show the emotion you’re trying to convey?
- Can you tell me more about the symbol you’re using here? What does it represent in your piece?
- If your artwork could speak, what would it say about gender equality?
- What do you want viewers to feel or think when they see your artwork?
- Are you thinking about how your art can show both a challenge and a hope?
- How does the energy of your lines convey your message?

Have students write a very short statement on the back on their artwork. Include:

- *Title*
  - Encourage students to give their artwork a creative title.
- *Message* 

  Template (if helpful):

  - My artwork shows [what was drawn/painted]. It tells about [a feeling/idea from Global Goal 5, like fairness or strength]. I want people to feel/think [a feeling or idea] when they see it.

If desired and time allows, students can share their artwork with the class.

**Positive Mark Making and Shared Strength**

Have students find a comfortable spot with a new, small piece of paper and one crayon or marker of their choice. Have students relax or close their eyes if comfortable.

Say: Think about one positive feeling you have about gender equality, fairness, strength, or being unique. It could be joy, peace, or confidence. 

Give students a minute or two to reflect.

Say: Now, slowly and gently, make some quiet, positive marks on your paper. Don’t worry about drawing objects, just lines or shapes that feel good, calm, and reflect those positive feelings.

Guide them to focus on the process.

After a minute, have all students put their marker/etc. down. Without speaking, have the whole class bring their small paper to the center of the room and lay their paper down gently next to all the others.

Explain: Look at all the different positive marks and colors. Notice how all our unique positive thoughts come together to create a big picture of shared strength and hope for gender equality.

Encourage students to observe the collective artwork silently.

Gently bring students back to their places, feeling calm and connected.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using Expressionist art help you understand Global Goal 5: Gender Equality and the feelings connected to fairness and unfairness?
- What did you learn about the power of using bold colors, strong lines and symbols to show big emotions in art?
- Which artworks or ideas from your classmates made you think or feel the most about fairness and respect for all genders, and why?
- What did the activity teach us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 5: Gender Equality?
- What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to promote fairness and respect in your school or home?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, artwork creation, and class discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of gender equality (fairness, equal opportunities, respect for all genders), as demonstrated through the symbolism, emotions, and message in the Expressionist artwork and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effort in creating the art piece. Look for evidence of connection to Global Goal 5 (does the artwork clearly represent feelings or ideas related to fairness, strength, challenges, or solutions for gender equality?), and use of Expressionist elements (are there attempts to use bold colors, strong lines, and expressive shapes to convey emotions and ideas?).
- Thoughtfulness of the brief art statements, showing a connection between the art and the goal.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

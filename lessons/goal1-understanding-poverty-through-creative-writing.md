## **Understanding Poverty Through Creative Writing**  
**(20-40 MINUTES)**  
**Materials**  
Whiteboard or large chart paper  
Markers  
Notebooks or paper  
Pens/pencils  
***Introduction***  
Divide the whiteboard or paper into three categories: "material poverty," "social poverty," and "emotional poverty"   
Have a few prompts ready to spark discussion. Examples: 

* *Material Poverty*: Lack of food, clean water, shelter, clothing, healthcare  
* *Social Poverty*: Limited access to education, employment, social networks, discrimination.  
* *Emotional Poverty*: Hopelessness, isolation, low self-esteem, anxiety, stress

Prompt students with questions: 

* Start with an open question: "What comes to mind when you think of poverty?" Allow students to share their initial thoughts.  
* Guide the discussion using your prepared prompts and the categories on the board. Encourage students to explore the connections between different aspects of poverty.

Key Questions to Ask:

* How might a lack of material resources affect someone's social connections or emotional well-being?  
* Can you think of examples of social poverty in our community or around the world?  
* How might poverty affect someone's dreams and aspirations?  
* What are some basic needs that people in poverty lack?  
* How does poverty affect relationships and opportunities?  
* What are some emotional challenges associated with poverty?

Record student responses in the appropriate categories  
Encourage students to challenge each other's ideas respectfully and to think critically about the root causes of poverty.

***Creative Writing Exercise***  
	Choose one of the following prompts, or create your own, based on the brainstorming session:

* Write a short story from the perspective of a character experiencing one or more aspects of poverty  
* Write a poem that explores the emotions associated with poverty (e.g., hopelessness, isolation, resilience)  
* Write a persuasive essay arguing for a specific solution to a poverty-related issue in your community or the world.

	Encourage students to use vivid imagery, sensory details, and emotional language to bring their writing to life.  
***Peer Review and Feedback***  
	Organize students into pairs or small groups to share their writing and provide constructive feedback.  
		Focus on the following aspects:

* Clarity of ideas  
* Use of language  
* Emotional impact  
* Connection to the topic of GG1: No Poverty

***Class Sharing***  
Invite volunteers to share their writing with the class.  
Facilitate a respectful and supportive discussion about the different perspectives and experiences expressed in the writing.

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* What was the most significant thing you learned about poverty, whether material, social, or emotional, through this creative writing exercise?  
* Did writing from a specific perspective or focusing on particular emotions deepen your understanding of the lived experience of poverty? If so, how?  
* What surprised you or challenged your initial thoughts about poverty during the brainstorming and writing process?  
* How did exploring the different categories of poverty (material, social, emotional) help you see the issue in a more complex way?  
* What connections did you draw between the different aspects of poverty (e.g., how might a lack ofmaterial resources impact emotional wellbeing)?  
* How did you approach choosing a perspective or focus for your creative writing piece?  
* What challenges did you encounter while trying to convey the realities of poverty through your chosen form?  
* How did you use literary devices like imagery, sensory details, and emotional language to bring your writing to life?  
* What did you learn about the power of storytelling and creative expression to communicate complex social issues?  
* Did the peer review process offer any new insights into your own writing or the topic of poverty?  
* Did any personal experiences or observations connect with the themes of poverty explored in this lesson?  
* What emotions did you experience while writing about poverty, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action?  
* What are some of the key takeaways from teh different writing pieces shared today that you think are important for others to understand about poverty?  
* How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in addressing poverty in your community or globally?

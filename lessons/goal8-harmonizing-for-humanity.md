**Introduction**  
Begin with a musical icebreaker to get students engaged and thinking about the connections between music and work.  
	[*Example:* Play a game where students identify different musical instruments and discuss the skills and training required to play them, linking it to the concept of specialized labor.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uiQYrsrn8KJ-aYiVIYw--phOWHbJ1ziApei-Q7ovukU/edit?usp=sharing)  
Introduce or re-introduce Global Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth  
Explain the core idea of ensuring fair and sustainable working conditions for everyone while promoting global economic progress. Open the discussion using guiding questions like:  
	Why do you think decent work is important?  
	What are some of the factors that contribute to economic growth?  
	How can we ensure that economic growth is sustainable and benefits everyone?  
Briefly introduce the different targets within Global Goal 8, highlighting their interconnectedness and importance, using the handout to provide a visual overview of the targets. Use guiding questions such as:  
	What are some of the challenges in achieving these targets?  
	How might these targets affect different people and communities around the world?  
**Exploring Musical Concepts**  
Have each student choose an instrument or assign them an instrument available.  
	*Assigned Instruments:* To ensure a variety of instruments and a balanced ensemble, assign instruments to students based on their existing skills, preferences, or the needs of the class.  
	*Student Choice:* If you have enough instruments and flexibility, allow students to choose an instrument they are interested in learning or already have some experience with.  
	*Combination:* You can use a combination of assignment and choice, allowing students to express preferences while ensuring a balanced ensemble.  
*Rhythm and Dynamics*  
Explain how rhythm and dynamics in music can represent different aspects of work.  
	*Example:* Fast tempo and strong dynamics can represent the energy and intensity of physical labor, while a slower tempo and softer dynamics might represent more contemplative or creative work.  
Have students experiment with different rhythms and dynamics on their instruments, creating musical representations of various types of work.  
	This can be connected to Target 8.2 (economic productivity) by discussing how different industries and sectors contribute to the overall economy.  
*Harmony and Melody*  
Discuss how harmony and melody in music can symbolize collaboration and the interconnectedness of different parts working together towards a common goal.  
	*Example:* Have students play simple chords or melodies together, emphasizing the importance of each part contributing to the overall sound,.  
	This can be connected to Target 8.5 (full and productive employment) by discussing the importance of diverse skills and talents contributing to a thriving workforce.  
*Form and Structure*  
Discuss how musical forms and structures can represent different systems and processes in the world of work.  
	*Example:* Compare a repetitive work song to a complex symphony, drawing parallels to different types of jobs and industries.  
	This can be connected to Target 8.3 (promoting entrepreneurship) by discussing how businesses and organizations need structure and organization to function effectively.

## **Rhymes for Knowledge: Hip Hop and Global Goal 4**
**(30-60 MINUTES)**  
**Materials**  
Audio  
Whiteboard or large chart paper  
Markers  
Lyric sheet for selected songs  
Instruments for beat-making or simple accompaniment if available  
Paper or notebooks  
Pens/pencils  
**Introduction**  
	Start with a simple beat, either teacher-led or using a pre-recorded loop. Have students clap along, then encourage them to add their own variations (snaps, foot stomps, vocal sounds, beatboxing, etc.)  
	Once comfortable with the rhythm, begin a freestyle circle. Go around the circle, each student adding one word that rhymes with the previous one. This builds quick thinking and word association skills.  
	Open a discussion. Example questions:

* How does rhythm play a role in learning? (memory aids, focus, etc.)  
* Why is freestyle/improvisation valuable? (thinking on your feet, confidence, etc.)  
* Connect to Goal 4; how can these skills help us in education and in life?

**Lyric Analysis: Education Anthems**  
	Choose 1-2 hip hop/rap songs with themes relevant to education. Examples:

* Nas, [I Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvVfgvHucRY)  
* Slick Rick, [Hey Young World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea-ezolZq5k)  
* 3 Titans ft. Menahan St Band, [The Life of a Scholar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjJf2ZnMUtY)  
* Young MC, [Principal’s Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE7fs2979Y4)  
* Fashawn, [Hey Young World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVjm9kK57-s)

	Play the song, providing lyric sheets if needed. Have students highlight lines that speak to them about education, obstacles, or aspirations.  
	Open a discussion. Example Questions:

* What’s the main message of each song about education?  
* Do any lyrics resonate with your own experience?  
* How do these artists use their platform to address Global Goal 4 themes?

**Rhyme and Reason: Writing for Change**  
	Students can work alone or in small groups, each assigned a different Global Goal 4 Target.  
	Have students write a short rap verse (4-8 lines) addressing their Target.  
	Writing prompts

* *Challenges:* What are the barriers to achieving this Target? (poverty, discrimination, lack of resources, etc.)  
* *Solutions:* What needs to happen to make progress? (policy changes, community action, individual effort, etc.)  
* *Empowerment:* How can education be a tool for change and personal growth?

	If time and resources allow, have students create a simple beat to go with their verse, or find an instrumental beat online that fits the mood.  
**Mic Drop: Performance and Feedback**  
	Each group/student performs or reads their verse (however they feel most comfortable).  
	Encourage them to add their own flair, even if they’re not comfortable rapping fully.  
	Open a discussion. Example questions:

* *Constructive Feedback:* Rather than focusing solely on the performance aspects (flow, rhythm, etc.), guide feedback towards the core message of the verse.  
  * Was the Target’s main challenge and at least one solution clearly expressed? Or did the verse end without any clarity of a potential solution? Could listeners understand this issue without prior knowledge?  
  * Did the verse evoke any emotions or thoughts about the issue? Was it memorable or thought-provoking?  
  * Were the solutions presented realistic or at least inspiring possibilities? Did they show understanding of the complexity of the problem?  
  * Did the verse offer a unique perspective or creative approach to the topic? Did it stand out from other verses?

	Connect the dots by synthesizing the individual verses into a cohesive understanding of Global Goal 4\. Example Questions:

* *Overlapping Themes:*  
  * Did you notice any themes or ideas that came up in multiple verses?  
  * How do these different perspectives show the interconnectedness of the various targets within Global Goal 4?  
* *Contrasting Experiences*  
  * Did any verses highlight contrasting experiences or challenges faced by different groups in accessing quality education?  
  * How do these differences emphasize the importance of equity and inclusion in education?  
* *Collective Vision*  
  * Based on what we’ve heard today, what does a world with quality education for all look like?  
  * How can you, as students, contribute to making this vision a reality?

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did using the style of hip hop, with its emphasis on rhythm and rhyme, help you connect with the themes of education and its challenges?  
* What did you learn about the power of lyrics and storytelling in music to convey complex social issues related to education?  
* How did the process of analyzing existing hip hop songs and creating your own verses deepen your understanding of the different targets within Global Goal 4?  
* What musical elements (rhythm, rhyme, flow) did you find most effective in communicating your message about education?  
* How can accessibility and cultural relevance of hip hop make discussions about important issues like education more engaging?  
* What new insights did you gain about the various barriers to quality and equitable education?  
* What potential solutions or calls to action for improving education emerged from your group’s or the class’s verses?  
* How did this activity demonstrate the interconnectedness of the different targets within Global Goal 4?  
* Did any of the lyrics or the process of writing your own verse resonate with your personal experiences or observations about education?  
* What emotions did you connect with while analyzing the songs and creating your own rhymes about educational challenges and solutions?  
* How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in advocating for quality education for all, both locally and beyond?

* Originality and effectiveness in crafting rap verses that utilize hip hop elements such as rhythm, rhyme, flow, and impactful language to convey the message about education.  
* How clearly and powerfully the finished rap verse communicates its intended message about Global Goal 4\. Did the verse successfully evoke thought or emotion in the listener?  
* Quality of the writing craft, including word choice, vivid imagery, and the conciseness of lyrics within the rap format.  
* Willingness to share work with confidence, using vocal delivery and expression to enhance the impact of the message (if applicable).

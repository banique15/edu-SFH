**Introduction**

Begin with an introduction to Surrealism. Explain its origins in the early 20th century, its connection to the subconscious mind, and its exploration of dreams, fantasies, and irrationality.

Highlight key characteristics:

- Unexpected juxtapositions of objects.
- Distorted or transformed forms.
- Dreamlike and illogical scenes.
- Emphasis on symbolism and metaphor.

Showcase examples of iconic Surrealist artworks, focusing on:

- Different techniques (painting, collage, sculpture, etc.)
- The power of visual storytelling and symbolism.

*Examples:*

- Salvador Dalí, [“The Persistence of Memory”](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79018) This iconic painting features melting clocks in a dreamlike landscape, exploring themes of time, memory, and the subconscious.
- René Magritte, [“The Treachery of Images (This is Not a Pipe)”](https://collections.lacma.org/node/239578) This work challenges the relationship between language and image, with the famous phrase “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (“This is not a pipe”) written beneath a depiction of a pipe.
- Meret Oppenheim, [“Le Déjeuner en Fourreure”](https://womennart.com/2018/03/14/le-dejeuner-en-fourrure-by-meret-oppenheim/) This sculpture, a fur-covered cup, saucer, and spoon, is a striking surrealist juxtaposition and the transformation of everyday objects.
- Max Ernst, [“The Elephant Celebes”](https://www.max-ernst.com/the-elephant-celebes.jsp) This painting features a bizarre and dreamlike machine-like creature, exploring themes of industrialization and the subconscious.
- Joan Miró, [Various Works](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=fc2dc54ee7eb1be7&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&sxsrf=AHTn8zr5E6e24OVfq8kTMhjYrRFMIhej_A:1743525805493&q=joan+mir%C3%B3&udm=2&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBtmuEdhfywyzhendkLDnhcrUz6wxBwARHD96EKWkSbZoqXb6uOuzhtkIDhbKMFBTOSopnMSiYQfajMRcOqHpFXiuixuphoEvyJTuX5yYBnQEZCINeCLcKyGdjmVXh6I0C2TnOrV4C_adia4N1YykHtn5cCl1VuW8naGtlXJhmYx6uELZeA&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwj_9Kvio7eMAxXG48kDHSh_FaAQtKgLegQICBAB&biw=1198&bih=727&dpr=2) Miró’s abstract and playful Surrealist paintings often feature biomorphic forms and vibrant colors, exploring themes of the imagination and the natural world.

Facilitate a brief discussion:

- What are your initial reactions to Surrealist art?
- What emotions or ideas do these artworks evoke?
- How does Surrealism challenge traditional ways of seeing the world?

Introduce/reintroduce Global Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. Emphasize the urgency of addressing unsustainable consumption patterns and the need for a shift towards more sustainable practices.

Divide students into groups and assign each group one or two specific targets from Goal 12, or assign the Goal as a whole.

Each group briefly discusses their assigned goal/targets and indicators, focusing on:

- The core issues addressed by their target/Global Goal 12.
- The connections between their target/Global Goal 12 and daily life.
- Examples of both unsustainable and sustainable practices related to their target/Global Goal 12.

Connect Surrealism and Global Goal 12 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how Surrealism can be used to explore themes of consumption and production. Ask questions like:

- How can the illogical and dreamlike nature of Surrealism help us visualize the absurdity of unsustainable practices?
- Can Surrealist techniques be used to create powerful metaphors for environmental destruction or the consequences of excessive consumption?
- How can Surrealism challenge viewers to rethink their relationship with material goods and the environment?

**Surrealist Techniques and Brainstorming**

Demonstrate and discuss key Surrealist techniques that students can incorporate into their artwork:

- *Juxtaposition:* Placing unrelated objects or images together in unexpected ways (e.g., a melting clock in a landfill).
- *Displacement:* Removing an object from its normal context and placing it in an unusual setting (e.g., a car growing like a plant).
- *Transformation:* Altering the form or function of an object (e.g., a plastic bottle morphing into a sea creature).
- *Scale distortion:* Changing the size of objects to create a sense of the uncanny or emphasize their importance (e.g., a giant plastic bag overwhelming a city).
- *Automatism:* Creating art spontaneously without conscious control, to tap into the subconcious (e.g., doodling and developing an image from the doodles).
- *Dream Imagery:* Incorporating elements from dreams or nightmares (e.g., a landscape made of discarded food).

Each group brainstorms ideas for a Surrealist artwork (painting, collage, etc.) (based on available supplies) that addresses their assigned Goal or target.

Encourage students to:

- Use symbolism and metaphor to convey their message.
- Experiment with different Surrealist techniques.
- Consider the emotional impact of their work.
- Connect their artwork to their own experiences and observations.

Examples

- **Target 12.1** *(Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns):* A collage depicting a city where sustainable businesses and practices coexist with unsustainable ones, highlighting the contrast and the need for change.
- **Target 12.2** *(Sustainable Management of Natural Resources):* A painting showing a barren landscape with human hands greedily reaching for the last remaining resources, symbolizing the depletion of natural resources.
- **Target 12.3** *(Food Waste):* A collage of photos of discarded food items, arranged in a visually striking but disturbing way, to represent the absurdity of food waste.
- **Target 12.4** *(Environmentally Sound Management of Chemicals and Waste):* A drawing showing toxic chemicals seeping into a dreamlike landscape, transforming it into a polluted and distorted environment.
- **Target 12.5** *(Substantially Reduce Waste Generation):* A drawing depicting everyday objects transforming into new, useful items through recycling and reuse, emphasizing the circular economy.
- **Target 12.6** *(Encourage Companies to Adopt Sustainable Practices):* A photocollage juxtaposing images of corporate headquarters with images of environmental destruction caused by unsustainable practices, critiquing corporate responsibility.
- **Target 12.7** *(Promote Sustainable Public Procurement):* A mixed-media artwork showing government buildings morphing into sustainable structures, powered by renewable energy and built with recycled materials.
- **Target 12.8** *(Ensure Information and Awareness for Sustainable Development):* A painting depicting people’s heads filled with images of both unsustainable and sustainable lifestyles, symbolizing the need for education and awareness.
- **Target 12.a** *(Supporting Developing Countries):* A collage showing hands from developed countries offering sustainable technologies to developing countries, symbolizing the transfer of knowledge and resources.
- **Target 12.b** *(Sustainable Tourism):* An artwork showing tourists interacting with a landscape in both destructive and sustainable ways, highlighting the impact of tourism and the need for responsible travel.
- **Target 12.c** *(Rationalize Inefficient Fossil-Fuel Subsidies):* A collage showing fossil-fuel products slowly being consumed by nature, symbolizing the phasing out of fossil fuels.

Groups develop a basic sketch or plan for their artwork, or, groups now split up and each individual plans their artwork, outlining key elements, techniques, and messages.

**Artwork Creation**

Students (groups or individuals) create their Surrealist artworks using the chosen medium.

Encourage students to:

- Experiment with different techniques and approaches.
- Use color, composition, and symbolism effectively.
- Collaborate and share ideas within their group (whether working in a group or individually).
- Express their creativity and personal interpretations.

Provide guidance, support, and feedback as needed.

**Presentation and Discussion**

Groups or individuals (select or entire class) present their completed artworks to the class.

Facilitate a discussion:

- What is the main message of the artwork?
- How did the artists use Surrealist techniques to convey their message?
- What impact do you think the artwork could have on viewers?
- What did you learn about Surrealism and its potential for addressing social and environmental issues?



**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did exploring Surrealism, with its focus on the illogical and dreamlike, help you to express your ideas and emotions about responsible consumption and production?
- What did you learn about the power of unexpected juxtapositions, distorted forms, or scale distortion in art to communicate messages about sustainability or unsustainable practices?
- Did creating a Surrealist artwork allow you to connect with the challenges of Global Goal 12 on a deeper, perhaps more intuitive or emotional, level than a purely realistic approach might have?
- What did you discover about your own creative voice when given the freedom to combine seemingly unrelated elements in your art?
- How can art, especially art that challenges conventional ways of seeing, help us rethink our relationship with material goods and the environment?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the urgency of addressing unsustainable consumption and production patterns through this artistic exploration?
- How did the diverse Surrealist artworks created by your classmates highlight the many different facets of responsible consumption (e.g., waste, natural resources, corporate responsibility, consumer awareness)?
- Did any specific artwork or the process of creating it make you think differently about your own consumption habits or those you observe in the world?
- What common themes or powerful messages about sustainability or the absurdity of waste emerged across the different artworks you saw?
- How does framing these issues through a “dreamscape” or “illogical” lens help to reveal the true nature of some unsustainable practices?
- Did creating your Surrealist artwork spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with consumption, waste, or sustainability?
- What emotions did you connect with while creating your artwork, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 12?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in promoting more sustainable practices in your daily life or community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to Surrealism, technique explorations, individual/group art creation, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 12, targets and core concepts. This will be evidenced through the symbolism and intention within the Surrealist artwork and the verbal explanations during sharing and discussion(s).

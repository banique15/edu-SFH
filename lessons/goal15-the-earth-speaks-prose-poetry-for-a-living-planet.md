## The Earth Speaks: Prose Poetry for a Living Planet
**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers


**Introduction**

Begin with a clear and engaging introduction to prose poetry.

- Prose poetry is a form of poetry that ues the language of prose (sentences, paragraphs) rather than the traditional line breaks of poetry.
- It allows for more narrative development and descriptive detail than traditional poetry, while still retaining poetic elements like imagery, rhythm, and figurative language.
- Think of it as a hybrid form; the freedom of prose with the intensity of poetry.

Share examples of prose poetry, focusing on:

- Different styles and approaches.
- The use of vivid language.
- The blend of storytelling and poetic expression.

Examples:

- [*Don’t Bother the Earth Spirit*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/101675/dont-bother-the-earth-spirit-who-lives-here)*,* Joy Harjo
- [*The Fall*](http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/russell_edson/poems/14919)*,* Russell Edson
- [*How I Go to the Woods*](https://www.uuworld.org/articles/two-prose-poems)*,* Mary Oliver
- [*February*](https://poets.org/poem/february-2)*,* Tamiko Beyer
- [*How to Tell the Difference Between a Raven and a Crow*](https://contrarymagazine.com/2022/two-poems-by-bethany-f-brengan/)*,* Bethany F. Brengan
- [*Tale of the Tortoise*](https://www.juxtaprosemagazine.org/tale-of-the-tortoise-by-bruce-weigl/)*,* Bruce Weigl

Facilitate a brief discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are you initial examples of prose poetry?
- What do you notice about its structure and language?
- How does it differ from both traditional poetry and regular prose?

Introduce/reintroduce UN Global Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Emphasize the importance of terrestrial ecosystems for life on Earth.

Provide a holistic overview of the goal, highlighting key themes:

- The beauty and diversity of life on land.
- The threats to ecosystems (deforestation, degradation, etc.).
- The importance of conservation and restoration.
- The interconnectedness of humans and nature.

Connect Prose Poetry and Global Goal 15 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how prose poetry can be used to explore themes related to Global Goal 15.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use prose poetry to vividly describe different terrestrial ecosystems?
- Can prose poetry capture the emotional impact of environmental destruction?
- How can we use poetic language to celebrate the resilience and beauty of nature?
- Can this form help us connect with the urgency of Global Goal 15?

**Exploring Prose Poety Techniques and Brainstorming**

Demonstrate and discuss key prose poetry techniques that students can incorporate into their writing.

- *Vivid Imagery:* Using sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to create a strong impression.
- *Figurative Language:* Employing metaphors, similes, personification, etc., to enhance meaning and evoke emotions.
- *Rhythm and Sound:* Paying attention to the rhythm and flow of language, even without line breaks.
- *Conciseness:* Using precise and impactful language to convey meaning efficiently.
- *Emotional Intensity:* Expressing a wide range of emotions, from awe and wonder to grief and anger.

Brainstorming Global Goal 15 Themes and Ideas

As a class, brainstorm specific aspects of Global Goal 15 that could be explored in prose poetry.

Examples:

- A specific ecosystem (rainforest, grassland, etc.).
- A particular species (endangered or thriving).
- A threat to biodiversity (deforestation, pollution).
- The experience of being in nature.
- The impact of climate change on land.
- The importance of conservation efforts.
- The relationship between humans and the land.

Students brainstorm their own prose poetry concepts, drawing inspiration from the class brainstorming. Encourage them to consider:

- A specific theme or aspect of Global Goal 15 that resonates with them.
- A clear focus or central idea for their poem.
- The emotions they want to evoke in the reader.
- The sensory details and figurative language they could use.

Provide examples of prose poetry prompts for Global Goal 15 to assist students if necessary:

- Describe a forest ecosystem, focusing on the sounds, smells, and textures.
- Write a prose poem from the perspective of an endangered animal.
- Capture the feeling of witnessing a deforestation or a wildfire.
- Explore the beauty and resilience of a grassland.
- Write about the impact of soil degradation on a farming community.
- Imagine a future where humans live in harmony with nature.

**Prose Poetry Writing**

Students individually write their prose poems, incorporating the techniques and ideas discussed.

Encourage students to:

- Use vivid imagery and sensory details to create a strong sense of place.
- Employ figurative language to enhance meaning and evoke emotions.
- Pay attention to the rhythm and flow of their sentences and paragraphs.
- Craft and concise and impactful piece.

Circulate to provide guidance and support.

**Sharing and Discussion**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).

Students share prose poems with their small groups.

Encourage positive and constructive feedback within the groups.

Have groups discuss:

- The effectiveness of the poems in conveying their chosen themes.
- The use of prose poetry techniques.
- The connection to Global Goal 15.

Ask guiding questions to assist in their discussions like:

- What was the main theme or idea of this poem?
- How effectively did the poem convey its message or evoke emotions?
- Which lines or phrases stood out to you, and why?
- What were the strengths of this poem? What could be improved?
- How did the author use imagery to create a vivid picture?
- Were there any examples of effective figurative language (metaphors, similes, etc.)?
- How did the rhythm and flow of the language contribute to the poem’s impact?
- Was the poem concise and impactful, or could it be more focused?
- Which aspects of Global Goal 15 did the poem address (even if indirectly)?
- Did the poem raise awareness about a specific environmental issue?
- Did it celebrate the beauty and importance of life on land?
- Did it inspire a sense of responsibility or a call to action?
- How does this poem help us understand the importance of protecting terrestrial ecosystems?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did writing in prose poetry - blending the flow of prose with the intensity of poetry - help you express your unique insights and feelings about life on land?
- What did you learn about the power of vivid imagery, sensory details, and figurative language in making a poem about terrestrial ecosystems feel real and impactful?

- What did you discover about your own creative voice when given the freedom to write without traditional line breaks, while still focusing on poetic elements?
- How can poetry, as an art form, help to humanize scientific data or complex ecological concepts related to Global Goal 15?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 15 and the importance of protecting, restoring, and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems through this poetic exploration?
- How did your poem, and those shared by your classmates, highlight the many different facets of life on land (e.g., forests, biodiversity, desertification, human impact)?
- What common themes or powerful messages about nature’s resilience or the need for conservation emerged across the different poems you heard?
- How does a poetic lens help us consider the emotional and instrinsic value of terrestrial ecosystems, beyond their utility to humans?
- Did writing your prose poem spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with nature or local ecosystems?
- What emotions did you connect with while writing your poem, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action for life on land?
- What is one key takeaway about terrestrial ecosystems and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about yoru own role in advocating for positive change for the environment?

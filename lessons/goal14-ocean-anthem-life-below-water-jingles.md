**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Audio
Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to jingles.

Explain that jingles are short, catchy songs used in advertising to promote products or services.

Highlight key characteristics:

- Simple melodies
- Repetitive lyrics
- Catchy hooks (the part that sticks in your head)
- Memorable and easy to sing

Play examples of well-known jingles (of different lengths):

- *Nationwide Insurance* “Nationwide is on your side” 
- *McDonald’s* “Ba da ba ba ba…I’m lovin’ it” 
- *State Farm Insurance* “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”
- *Burger King* “Have it your way”
- *Folgers Coffee* “The Best Part of Wakin’ Up Is Folgers In Your Cup”
- *Kit Kat* “Gimme a Break”
- *Doublemint Gum* “Double Your Pleasure”
- *O’Reilly Auto Parts* “O-O-O-O’Reilly…”
- *Chili’s* “Baby Back Ribs”

Facilitate a brief discussion:

- What are some jingles you can remember?
- What makes a jingle effective?
- How can we use the power of jingles to promote a message?

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the importance of the oceans for life on Earth and the urgency of protecting them. If wanted, briefly review the key targets and indicators.

Connect jingles and Global Goal 14 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how jingles can be used to promote ocean conservation.
Ask guiding questions like:

- How can we use the catchy nature of jingles to raise awareness about ocean issues?
- Can we create jingles that inspire people to take action?
- How can we use simple melodies and lyrics to communicate complex ideas?

**Jingle Structure and Brainstorming**

Explain the basic structure of a jingle:

- *Hook:* The main, most memorable part (often the chorus).
- *Verse(s):* Short sections that provide information or tell a story.
- *Tagline:* A short, memorable phrase that summarizes the message.

As a class, brainstorm key messages and concepts related to Global Goal 14.

Examples:

- “Protect marine life”
- “Reduce plastic pollution”
- “Stop overfishing”
- “Keep our oceans clean”
- “The ocean is our future”

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students)

Assign each group a specific aspect of Global Goal 14 (e.g., pollution, overfishing, etc.) to focus on OR have groups create a jingle about Global Goal 14 as a whole, allowing for more creative freedom.

Have each group brainstorm ideas for their jingle, focusing on:

- A catchy hook.
- Simple and informative lyrics.
- A memorable melody.
- Rhythms and sounds they can create with their bodies or simple instruments available in the classroom.
- A tagline that summarizes their message.

**Jingle Creation and Rehearsal**

Lyric Writing

- Groups write the lyrics for their jingles, keeping them concise and easy to understand.
- Encourage the use of:
  - Repetition
  - Rhyme (optional, but can make it catchier).
  - Strong verbs and imagery.

Melody development

- Groups create a simple melody for their lyrics. Emphasize:
  - A limited range of notes.
  - A clear and memorable rhythm.
  - A melody that fits the tone and message of the lyrics.
  - Melodies that can be sung without instruments or with the limited instruments available in the classroom.

Rhythmic Accompaniment

- Groups develop a rhythmic accompaniment using body percussion or simple percussion available in the classroom. Encourage:
  - Simple and repetitive patterns.
  - Variety in sounds (claps, snaps, stomps, etc.)
  - Coordination between the vocal melody and the rhythm.

Rehearsal

- Groups rehearse their jingles, focusing on:
  - Clear pronunciation and articulation.
  - Rhythm and timing.
  - Energy and enthusiasm.
  - Coordination between singers and body percussion.

**Jingle Performances**

Each group performs their jingle for the class. Encourage:

- Clear and confident delivery.
- Enthusiasm and energy.
- Clear communication of the message.

Provide positive feedback and encouragement after each performance.


**Reflection and Summary**

- What did you learn about the power of short, impactful phrases and simple melodies to communicate complex issues like marine pollution or overfishing?

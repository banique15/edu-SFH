	Can be both collected by students and in classroom for student use. Encourage students to collect responsibly and ethically, avoiding damage to living plants or habitats.

Glue

String or twine

General art supplies (crayons, markers, colored pencils, etc.)

Cardboard or thick paper

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

Notebooks or paper

Pens/Pencils

**Introduction**

	Begin by introducing the concept of natural art. Explain that it’s an art form that uses materials found in nature, like leaves, sticks, and stones, etc. to create art. It’s a way for artists to show how much they care about the natural world. 

	Show examples of famous land artists and their work, explaining that a lot of land artists’ work is often temporary and reminds us of the beautiful, but fragile, nature around us.

	Introduce Global Goal 15: Life On Land. Explain that this goal is all about protecting the land we live on. Talk about the importance of forests, deserts, and grasslands, and all the amazing plants and animals that call them home. 

	Tell students that today, they will focus on biodiversity, which is the word for all the different kinds of life on Earth. Explain that every single plant and animal, no matter how big or small, is a piece of a bigger puzzle, and if one piece goes missing, it affects everything else.

**The Biodiversity Puzzle Brainstorm**

	Tell students that, as a class, they will create a biodiversity puzzle that is both a shared art piece and a brainstorming activity. This can be created on a large piece of paper placed on the floor, or on a table.

	*The Healthy Ecosystem*

- Prompt students to imagine a healthy forest or grassland. Ask guiding questions like:
  - What would you see there? 
  - What would you find on the ground?
- Ask students to bring their collected natural items/choose from the classroom collection, and place them on the paper or table to create a vibrant, diverse ecosystem. Encourage students to use different types of leaves for plants, small twigs for trees, or pebbles for a riverbed. 
- As they add items, ask what each item represents to them and to the larger art piece.

	*The Missing Piece*

- Prompt students to imagine that one type of plant or animal is in danger and disappears from the ecosystem the class just created. Ask guiding questions like:
  - What would that look like in our art?
  - How would this affect our ecosystem?
- Ask a few students to deliberately remove items from the art piece, creating an empty space.
- Ask students how the art piece looks now. Does it look full and healthy, or like there is a missing piece?

	*The Restoration*

- Prompt students to show how we can help heal the ecosystem, asking guiding questions like:
  - What can we do to help restore a missing piece of the puzzle?
  - What kinds of things can people do to help nature heal?
- Invite a new group of students to add items back or add new ones to fill in the empty spaces. Ask each student to talk about their “action” when they add an item.
  - Examples: 
    - “I’m putting this flower here to show how we can plant new things.”
    - “I’m adding this group of leaves to show how we can help a group of animals have a home again.”

	This activity turns the abstract concept of biodiversity into a visual, hands-on puzzle that students can create and fix.

**Individual Story Art**

	Now, tell students that they will each create their own art pieces, choosing one powerful idea from the collaborative puzzle to create their own story. Ensure all students have cardboard or sturdy paper and glue. If desired, students can also use crayons, markers, colored pencils, etc. to assist in the creation of their natural art.

- *Choosing a story:* Encourage students to choose a story to tell with their art. It could be about a specific endangered animal, a beautiful forest that needs to be protected, or a piece about how we can help nature grow.
- *Using our materials:* Students will use the natural items collected/available in class to tell their story. Remind them that they don’t have to glue everything down right away; they can arrange the items first until they find a story they like.

	Walk around the room and offer guidance. Help students to think about how to use different shapes, colors, and textures to tell their story (e.g., sharp twigs to represent a threat, soft leaves to represent safety).

**Small Group Gallery Walk and Storytelling**

	When the art is finished, have students break into small groups of 3-4. Each group will have its own mini “gallery walk” where they share their art and discuss it. This provides a safe, comfortable space for every student to share their work and voice. Have students discuss the works within their small groups, asking guiding questions like:

- What is the main story of this art piece?
- What natural materials were used, and why were they chosen?
- How does this art connect to Global Goal 15 and the idea of protecting biodiversity?

	After all students have shared in the small groups, you can invite a few volunteers from the groups to share their favorite part of the activity with the whole class.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did working directly with materials from nature feel different from using only crayons or paint?
- What did you learn about the different textures and shapes you can find in the natural world?
- After creating your art and seeing the work of your classmates, what is one small thing you can do to help protect a part of nature near you?
- How does our art show that we all have a role to play in protecting life on land?
- The art we created today is a story. How does art help us share important messages with people without using words?
- What did you learn about the importance of all living things through this activity?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm puzzle, individual art creation, small gallery group walk, and group discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 and the concept of biodiversity. This will be shown through the symbolism in the natural art pieces and the verbal explanations during the small group sharing.
- Originality and effectiveness in using collected natural items to convey a clear message. Were the materials used in an innovative way?
- How clearly and powerfully the finished artwork communicates its intended message. Did the art successfully evoke a feeling or tell a story related to life on land and biodiversity?
- Ability to articulate artistic choices and to provide thoughtful feedback about classmates’ artwork, connecting it to Global Goal 15 themes.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life on land.

## Our Shared Story: Devised Theater for Peace

**(30-60 MINUTES)**


**Materials:**

Open space suitable for movement and group work

Whiteboard or largechart  paper 

Markers

Paper
Pens/pencils

[Optional] Simple, easily manipulated props that can be used symbolically (e.g., fabric scraps, ropes, blocks, signs with keywords like “power,” “truth,” “voice”)

**Introduction**

	Begin by introducing the idea of Devised Theater. Explain that it’s like a group puzzle where everyone brings a piece, and they are then put together to create a brand new picture. In devised theater, you don’t start with a script, but with an idea, a feeling, or a picture; then using bodies and voices to create a story.

	Introduce the simple building blocks that will be used to create the story:

- *Movement:* Using movements to show an idea (e.g., a clenched fist to show anger).
- *Sound:* Using voices to make sounds or say short words that express a feeling.
- *Teamwork:* Working together to build a scene, responding to each other’s movements and sounds.

	Introduce Global Goal 16. Explain that the goal is all about creating a world where everyone is safe, treated fairly, and has a voice. It’s about building strong communities and trustworthy leaders. The class will use devised theater to physically show what a world with and without peace and justice can look like.

**The Justice Machine**

	Explain to the class that they will build a human “justice machine” to show how different parts can work together to create a fair and peaceful outcome. The teacher will be the “conductor” of the machine.

	*The Idea*

- Tell students that they are going to build a machine for justice.
- Ask the students to think about what a specific piece of this machine would be. Prompt students to think about different parts of a peaceful and fair society to help with ideas. Ask guiding questions like:
  - What would this piece of the machine look like?
  - What would it sound like?
  - How would it move?
- Ask a student, or have a volunteer start by making a simple movement and a sound that represents one part of the justice “machine.” Have them explain what their part of the machine is. Emphasize that there are no wrong answers.

  Example:

  - A student might stand still and make a “hum” sound to be a “rule.”

	*Adding a Part*

- Prompt the next student or a volunteer to add their part to the machine.
- Ask the students to think about what movement and sound they can add that works with the part/person before them. Ask guiding questions like:
  - What would this piece of the machine look like?
  - What would it sound like?
  - How would it move?
- The next student will join the first, adding a new movement and/or sound that connects.

  Example:

  - The next student might clap their hands to the “hum” and say “fairness.”

	*The Machine Grows*

- Continue adding students, one by one, until the whole class (or a group you are happy with) is part of the “machine.”
- The sounds and movements should build on each other to create a collective, rhythmic piece. 

  Example:

  - The “machine” might grow to have a “law” that makes a strong, steady tapping sound or a “voice” that speaks up with a clever, honest tone.

	This activity makes the abstract idea of a just institution feel real and personal. It shows that a big, strong system is simply a collection of many different people working together.

**Devised Scenes: Problems and Solutions**

	After students have practiced building a collaborative scene through their machine, split them into small groups (3-4 students per group) to create their own, devised scenes.

	Guide them through the process:

- *Choosing a Story:* Each group will choose a theme to explore, related to Global Goal 16. They should use their bodies and voices to “show, don’t tell” a story about it.

  Theme Examples and Guiding Questions:

  - *A Clenches Fist Opening (Reducing Violence)*
    - How would you show a moment of anger and tension?
    - How would you show that tension slowly being released and turning into calm?
  - *Trapped, Then Free (Ending Abuse)*
    - How can you use your bodies to show someone feeling trapped or restricted?
    - How would you show them becoming free and feeling safe?
  - *The Broken Scale (Access to Justice)*
    - How can you show a situation that feels unbalanced or unfair?
    - How would you show someone finding a way to balance the scales and find justice?
  - *The Web of Lies (Reducing Corruption)*
    - How can you show a person getting stuck in a web of lies and secrets?
    - How would you show a person breaking free from the web and revealing the truth?
  - *A Missing Piece of the Puzzle (Inclusive Communities)*
    - How would you use movement to show a group of people working together, but with a missing space in their group?
    - How would you show a new person finding their place and completing the puzzle?
  - *A Locked Door (Access to Information)*
    - How can you use your bodies to show someone trying to get through a locked door or a closed-off space?
    - How would you show a new person opening the door and sharing the information with others?

	Give groups time to work together to create their scenes. Encourage them to be creative with their movements and sounds and to work as a team.

**Sharing Our Stories**

	Once the groups are ready, have them perform their short scenes for the class. This is a chance for students to share their creative work and for the class to see how different groups interpreted the same/similar ideas.

	After each group has performed their scene, have a short discussion, asking guiding questions like:

- What story did you see?
- What movement or sound stood out to you the most?
- How did this scene make you feel?
- How does this scene connect to Global Goal 16?

	Then, let the group that just performed quickly share their story and connection to Global Goal 16.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did this lesson help you understand what peace and justice feel like in a new way?
- What did you learn about the power of using your body and voice to tell a dramatic story?
- What is one small thing you can do to help make your classroom or community a more fair and peaceful place?
- What did you learn about working together to solve a problem?
- How did building a story together feel like building a community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the collaborative brainstorm, small group scene creation, performance, and class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., peace, justice, fairness) as demonstrated through the intention and content of the movements and vocalizations in the dramatic scenes.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying devised theater elements (e.g., movement, sound, teamwork) to explore and communicate the chosen theme.
- How clearly and powerfully the scenes communicated an understanding of Global Goal 16. Did the scenes successfully evoke thought or emotion in the audience?
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively to create the shared piece.
- Thoughtful engagement as an audience member, evidenced by attentive listening and the ability to articulate what was observed and learned from the performances.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for social justice and the complexities of achieving peace and fairness.

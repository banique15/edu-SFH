**Closing Activity Options**

`	`**One Word Summary:** Ask each student to think of one word encapsulating their biggest takeaway or feeling about climate action after this musical exploration. Have them share their word with the class, briefly explaining their choice. **Bonus:** Collect all the words to make a word cloud.

`	`**Quote Connection:** Share an inspiring quote about climate action or environmental stewardship. Facilitate an open discussion about how this quote connects to the music and activity they experienced in class. **Example:** “Climate change is the single biggest thing that humans have ever done on this planet. The one thing that needs to be bigger is our movement to stop it.” - Bill McKibben

`	`**Songwriting Challenge:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to write a short song or rap verse about climate action. Encourage them to consider the challenges, solutions, and the importance of action surrounding the climate.

`	`**Global Goal Playlist:** Have students work individually or in groups to brainstorm other songs that they think relate to different aspects of Global Goal 13. They can briefly explain their choices.

`	`**Creative Writing Connection:** Have students write a short story, poem, or song lyrics inspired by the music and discussions, focusing on thei feelings or ideas about climate change and the need for action.

**Visual Art Connection:** Have students create a quick sketch or image that comes to mind when they listen to the song(s) in the context of climate change. They can share their artwork and explain the connection.

**Soundscape of Climate Change:** Divide students into small groups and challenge them to create a short soundscape (using their voices, body percussion, or classroom objects) that represents either the impacts of climate change or actions being taken to address it.

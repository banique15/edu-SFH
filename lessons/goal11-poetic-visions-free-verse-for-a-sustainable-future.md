    - A place where there are opportunities for jobs and education.
    - A place where I feel like I belong.
  - *Environmental Aspects*
    - Lots of green spaces and trees.
    - Clean air and water.
    - Good public transportation that reduces pollution.
    - Places to safely ride my bike.
    - Effective recycling and waste management.
    - A place that is working to combat climate change.
  - *Physical Structures*
    - Affordable housing.
    - Reliable public transportation.
    - Good internet access.

Introduce free verse poetry as a form that breaks away from traditional rules of rhyme and meter. It allows poets to express themselves with greater flexibility and freedom.

Key points:

- *No Set Rules*
  - Unlike traditional poetry, free verse doesn’t follow a strict rhyme scheme or meter (a pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables).
  - This freedom allows poets to focus on the content and emotional impact of their words.
- *Emphasis on Natural Rhythm*
  - Free verse often mimics the natural rhythms of speech.
  - Line breaks and stanza breaks are used to create pauses and emphasize certain words or phrases.
- *Focus on Imagery and Language*
  - Free verse poets often use vivid imagery, sensory details, and strong verbs to create a powerful impression.
  - The way words are arranged on the page can also contribute to the poem’s meaning and impact.
- *Capturing Raw Emotion*
  - Because of its flexibility, free verse is well-suited for expressing raw emotions and unfiltered experiences.
  - It can capture the complexities of urban life, from the excitement of a bustling street to the loneliness of a crowded city.
- *Examples*
  - Langston Hughes: Known for his powerful free verse poems that captured the experiences of African Americans in urban settings.
    - [*I Hear America Singing*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46480/i-hear-america-singing)*,* Walt Whitman
    - [*Dreams*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/150995/dreams-5d767850da976)*,* Langston Hughes
    - [*Harlem*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem)*,* Langston Hughes
    - [*Chicago*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12840/chicago)*,* Carl Sandburg
    - [*In a Station of the Metro*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12675/in-a-station-of-the-metro)*,* Ezra Pound
    - [*The Photographer*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/162736/the-photographer)*,* Madeleine Cravens
    - [*Sky*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/155006/sky-5fd041b4bcda0)*,* Emily Spencer
- Emphasize that free verse is about expressing oneself authentically.

## **Power of Persuasion: Championing Clean Energy With Creative Writing**
**(30-60 MINUTES)**  
**Materials**  
Paper or notebooks  
Pens/pencils  
Images or videos showcasing the impact of energy issues, both positive and negative  
\[Optional\] examples of persuasive writing  
	Speeches, opinion articles, persuasive essays, ads  
**Introduction**  
	Begin with a thought-provoking question or quote about energy, such as:

* Imagine a world where everyone has access to clean, affordable energy. What would that world look like?  
* Is is possible to power the world without harming it?  
* Can we create a future where energy is both abundant and sustainable?  
* How can we ensure that the benefits of clean energy reach everyone, regardless of their location or income?  
* “We have a choice. We can remain addicted to fossil fuels with all the consequences that brings, or we can break the habit, embrace the clean energy alternatives and the new jobs they create.” \- Barack Obama  
* “Renewable energy is not only good for the environment, it’s good for the economy.” \- Paul Krugman  
* “The Stone Age didn’t end for lack of stones, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.” \- Sheikh Zaki Yamani  
* Over 770 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity. Source: [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/recommendations-of-the-global-commission-on-people-centred-clean-energy-transitions/recommendation-5)

	Re-introduce Global Goal 7 if necessary: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.  
	Connect to students’ lives by facilitating a brief discussion about how energy impacts their daily lives, asking questions like:

* How do you use energy at home, school, and in your community?  
* Have you ever experienced a power outage or energy shortage? How did it affect you?  
* What are some of the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption that you’re aware of?

**Understanding Persuasive Writing**  
	Explain the purpose and key elements of persuasive writing, emphasizing the use of

* *Strong arguments and evidence:* Facts, statistics, expert opinions, and personal anecdotes.  
* *Emotional appeals:* Connecting with the reader’s values, beliefs, and concerns.  
* *Call to action:* Clearly stating what the writer wants the reader to do or believe.

	Examine examples of persuasive writing related to energy or other social issues. Identify the techniques used and discuss their effectiveness.   
	Examples:

* [How Dare You](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit), Greta Thunberg  
  * Thunberg uses powerful language and repetition to express her anger and frustration, directly addressing world leaders and accusing them of inaction.  
  * Thunberg establishes her credibility by citing scientific evidence and highlighting the urgency of the climate crisis.  
  * Thunberg demands immediate and drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
* [The Story of Bottled Water,](https://www.storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-bottled-water/) The Story of Stuff Project  
  * The video uses facts and statistics to debunk the myth that bottled water is safer or healthier than tap water.  
  * The video reveals the environmental impact of bottled water production and the tactics used by corporations to create demand.  
  * The video encourages viewers to reduce their reliance on bottled water and switch to reusable containers.  
* [Renewable Energy is Key to Fighting Climate Change](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/noah-long/renewable-energy-key-fighting-climate-change#:~:text=Mike%20Linenberger%20/%20NREL,no%20signs%20of%20slowing%20down.), Noah Long & Kevin Steinberger  
  * This written piece uses clear explanations and examples to make the case for renewable energy as an impactful climate solution.

**Goal/Target Deep Dive and Brainstorming**  
	Distribute a [concise fact sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ZmQ8CJovHgLOcGflCS6xQ97bObbU3utcuoiq6-GqKI/edit?usp=drive_link) about Global Goal 7, highlighting key statistics, challenges, and potential solutions.  
	Explain that students can either choose the overall goal of Affordable and Clean Energy or focus on one specific target that resonates with them.

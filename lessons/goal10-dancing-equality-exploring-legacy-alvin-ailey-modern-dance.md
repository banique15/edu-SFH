**Exploring Ailey’s Movement Style**  
Begin with a gentle warm-up to prepare students’ bodies for movement.  
Play upbeat and rhythmic music to energize students and get them moving during the warm-up. This can include a variety of music selections, including spirituals, gospel, blues, and jazz, reflecting the diverse influences in Ailey’s choreography.  
	Examples  
		[Wade in the Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPCXRNFzUI)  
		[Sinner Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adi_RESrcyQ&list=PLJa-XdbM-QRCVfy4TSovIxykw9uLAbZMY&index=11)  
		[Revelations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPCXRNFzUI&list=PLJa-XdbM-QRCVfy4TSovIxykw9uLAbZMY) (by Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater)  
Include stretches, basic exercises, and simple movement sequences.  
Introduce basic modern dance techniques inspired by Ailey’s style.  
*Contraction and Release:* Explore the concept of contracting and releasing the torso, a key element in Ailey’s choreography.  
*Fall and Recovery:* Practice falling and recovering from the floor, emphasizing fluidity and control.  
*Flexibility and Extension:* Encourage students to explore their flexibility and range of motion through stretches and extensions.  
*Grounded Movement:* Emphasize the importance of connecting with the floor and using gravity to create powerful and expressive movements.  
Introduce a basic movement vocabulary inspired by Ailey’s choreography.  
	Examples

* Strong, grounded movements representing resilience and determination (connection to Target 10.1 \- income growth).  
* Contracting movements representing oppression or struggle (connection to Target 10.2 \- social inclusion).  
* Reaching movements symbolizing hope and aspiration (connection to Target 10.3 \- equal opportunity).  
* Have students share their own movement vocabulary and how it connects to different targets in Global Goal 10\.

Combine the basic techniques and movement vocabulary to create short movement phrases. Demonstrate the phrases and have students practice them, encouraging them to explore their own interpretations and expressions.  
**Dance and Global Goal 10**  
Facilitate a brainstorming session where students generate ideas for dance pieces that connect to different targets within Global Goal 10, or to the Goal holistically.   
Encourage students to consider how music can enhance their expression of the chosen target/Global Goal 10\.  
	Guiding Questions

* What are some movement qualities or dynamics that could represent each target?  
* How can we use dance to convey the challenges and opportunities associated with each target?  
* How can we use dance to express the interconnectedness of the different targets within Global Goal 10?

		Examples

* **Target 10.1** *(Income Growth):* Create a dance piece with upward reaching movements and dynamic changes in levels, representing the growth and progress of individuals and communities overcoming poverty.  
* **Target 10.2** *(Social Inclusion):* Create a dance with movements that connect and intertwine, symbolizing the inclusion and integration of diverse individuals and groups in society.  
* **Target 10.3** *(Equal Opportunity):* Choreograph a dance with movements that break free from restrictions and limitations, representing the struggle for equality and the dismantling of discriminatory barriers.

* **Target 10.5** *(Financial Markets):* Develop a dance with intricate and interconnected movements, representing the complexity of financial systems and the need for regulation and transparency.  
* **Target 10.6** *(Global Institutions):* Choreograph a dance with a group of dancers moving in unison and with individual expression, representing the importance of global cooperation and diverse voices in decision-making.

* **Target 10.c** *(Remittances):* Create a dance piece with movements that connect and bridge distances, representing the flow of remittances and their impact on families and communities.

Divide students into groups, the size of your choosing.  
Each group selects one target from Global Goal 10 (or can focus on the Goal holistically) and creates a short dance piece (2-3 minutes) inspired by Ailey’s style and incorporating the movement vocabulary learned earlier.  
Encourage students to be creative and expressive in their choreography, using movement to convey the essence of their chosen target.  
Guide students to select music that complements their choreography and effectively conveys the message of their chosen target/Global Goal 10\.  
Encourage them to explore a range of musical styles and consider how the music can enhance the emotional impact of their dance. If students are struggling to find appropriate music, provide suggestions or curate a playlist of diverse music options for them to choose from.  
Provide time for students to rehearse and refine their dance pieces.  
**Sharing and Discussion**  
Have each group share their dance pieces with the class.  
Encourage the audience to observe carefully and reflect on the messages and emotions conveyed through the movement.  
Facilitate a class discussion about the dance pieces, focusing on the connection to Global Goal 10, the effectiveness of the choreography, and the overall impact of the performances.

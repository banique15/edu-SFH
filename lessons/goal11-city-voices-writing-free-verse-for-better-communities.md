**Introduction**

Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities.

Clarify that Global Goal 11 is like a huge promise the world has made: a promise to build cities and towns that are great places to live, for everyone. Emphasize that this means cities that are:

- *Inclusive:* Welcoming and fair for all people.
- *Safe:* Places where everyone feels secure.
- *Resilient:* Strong enough to handle challenges like bad weather or problems.
- *Sustainable:* Good for the planet and for people for a long time.

Begin by showing a diverse range of images related to Global Goal 11. Examples:

    - Feelings: Fear, unsafe, vulnerability.

Invite students to look at the images and share their initial feelings or impressions. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are some of the specific things you notice in the images? What do you see that makes a place look like a good community, and what do you see that makes a place look like it has challenges?
- How do these different images make you feel? Do you feel calm and happy when you see the parks, or maybe a little worried when you see a dark street?
- Do any of these images remind you of your own city or neighborhood? What makes them feel similar or different?

Introduce Free Verse Poetry. Explain that free verse is a special kind of poetry that doesn’t follow any strict rules, like rhyming or having a certain number of syllables. Clarify that the freedom of free verse lets poets focus on telling a story or showing a feeling using vivid imagery and strong words, just like we see in the photos. Emphasize that the most important rule of free verse is to express yourself authentically.

Show selected examples of age-appropriate free verse poems.

Examples:

- [*I Hear America Singing*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46480/i-hear-america-singing)*,* Walt Whitman
- [*Dreams*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/150995/dreams-5d767850da976)*,* Langston Hughes
- [*Harlem*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem)*,* Langston Hughes
- [*Chicago*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12840/chicago)*,* Carl Sandburg
- [*In a Station of the Metro*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/12675/in-a-station-of-the-metro)*,* Ezra Pound
- [*The Photographer*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/162736/the-photographer)*,* Madeleine Cravens
- [*Sky*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/155006/sky-5fd041b4bcda0)*,* Emily Spencer

Facilitate a discussion about the poems with guiding questions like:

- What do you notice about these poems? Do they rhyme? Do they have a clear beat or rhythm?
- What words in these poems paint a picture in your mind? What do you see or feel when you read them?
- How does the way the words are arranged (the line breaks) make you read or hear the poem in a certain way?
- How can a poem that doesn’t have rules be a powerful way to talk about a city or community?

**Warm Up: Sensory City Snapshots**

Instruct students to relax, and gently close their eyes if comfortable.

*Listen to the City*

- Play a short (15-20 second) audio clip of a bustling city street or busy park.
- Instruct students to focus on what they hear, and then to let their imagination create a mental picture of the scene

  Examples:

- [City Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDWZkXjDYsc)
- [Kids Playing in Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHsjHPKuU0I)
- [City Park Sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJQQrI7nCeY)

*The Senses Speak*

- After the clip ends, ask students to share one word or a short phrase from their mental picture that relates to a specific sense.
  - *Sight:* What is one thing you saw in your mental picture? (e.g., red bricks, tall buildings, a yellow bus, green leaves).
  - *Sound:* What is one specific sound you heard? (e.g., a car horn, a bird chirping, a bell ringing, kids playing).
  - *Smell:* What is one thing you smelled? (e.g., fresh rain, car exhaust, fresh bread, clean air).
  - *Feeling (Touch):* What is one thing you felt? (e.g., the wind on your face, warm sun, cool pavement, a comfortable bench).

*Building a Snapshot*

- As a class, combine a few different students’ sensory words to create one short, descriptive, “snapshot” of the scene. (e.g., A red bus honks, the smell of fresh bread is in the air, and the sun feels warm on my face.) Repeat if time allows.

Affirm the students’ ability to build a full picture with just a few words.

Conclude warm up by explaining that using sensory details like these is key to painting a picture with words in free verse poetry.

**City Senses Collage**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a set of City Senses Cards (15-30 cards per set). Each card will have a word or phrase on it and will fit into one of three categories:

- City Elements
- Senses
- Feelings/Ideas

[ Card Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JHoaE_4pW6BrgW9US8nDO5mMBQ9QVjGx6OADeKvUCU/edit?usp=sharing)

Instruct groups to lay all their cards out, then choose 3-5 cards and arrange them into a creative “collage” of ideas that tells a mini-story about a city.

- *Example Collage 1*
  - *Cards:* A quiet park + the feeling of sunshine + lonely.
    - *Story Idea:* A beautiful sunny park where no one is playing.
- *Example Collage 2*
  - *Cards:* A broken road + the sound of laughing + teamwork.
    - *Story Idea:* People in a community are fixing a road together.
- *Example Collage 3*
  - *Cards:* A crowded bus + the sound of music + a feeling of hope + working together.
    - *Story Idea:* A crowded bus ride where everyone is listening to music together, feeling connected and hopeful for the future.
- *Example Collage 4*
  - *Cards:* An old bridge + the sight of trash + lonely + new ideas.
    - *Story Idea:* A person walking across an old, trash-filled bridge feels lonely and sad, but then a new idea comes to them about cleaning up the bridge with the community.
- *Example Collage 5*
  - *Cards:* A bustling market + the smell of fresh fruit + feeling proud + working hard.
    - *Story Idea:* A busy market where people are selling fresh fruit, and feeling proud of their hard work.
- *Example Collage 6*
  - *Cards:* A tall factory + the sound of machines + angry + a clean future.
    - *Story Idea:* A factory is making loud sounds that are making the community angry. They come together to brainstorm a new idea for how to make the factory clean for the future.
- *Example Collage 7*
  - *Cards:* A quiet library + the feeling of sunshine + peaceful + learning.
    - *Story Idea:* A peaceful library where sunlight is streaming in, people are reading and learning together, feeling calm and happy.

Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:

- What story is your card collage telling?
- How do you think you could use those words to write a free verse poem?

**My City Poem**

Explain that the students will now create their own free verse poem, using the ideas from their City Senses Collage, or any other ideas that have been sparked about Global Goal 11. Remind the class that their poems should tell a sotry or show a feeling about a sustainable city or community.

Encourage students to:

- *Paint a Picture:* Use vivid imagery and sensory details (what they see, hear, feel, etc.) to bring their poem to life.
- *Use Strong Words:* Choose powerful verbs and interesting adjectives.
- *Break the Rules:* Don’t worry about rhyming or a specific beat.
- *Use Line Breaks:* Use line breaks to create pauses, or to emphasize certain words or phrases. Remind students that line breaks are like silent punctuation.

Provide examples of prompts if needed:

- Write a poem about a day in a perfectly safe and happy park.
- Write a poem from the point of view of a crack in the pavement, watching the city change.
- Write a poem about the sounds of your neighborhood at night, and what they make you feel about safety.
- Write a poem about a bus ride, and all the different people you see and what you imagine they are doing.
- Write a poem about a new community garden and all the things that are growing in it.

Circulate, offering guidance and encouragement and asking guiding questions like:

- How can you show a feeling of happiness or safety without just saying the word?
- Can you describe what the street smells or sounds like after it rains?
- Where could you use a line break to make a word or feeling stand out?
- What’s the one most important picture you want your poem to show?
- How can you tell a story about a challenge in the city and how it gets better?

**Sharing and Discussion**

Explain that students will now share their poems. This can be done through volunteer readings, or have students pair up to read their poems to each other (can switch one or multiple times with pairs so students can read and hear several different poems).

Facilitate a class discussion about the poems, asking guiding questions like:

- What images or feelings did the poems evoke for you?
- What was a powerful line or phrase you heard? Why did it stand out?
- How did the poems connect to Global Goal 11 and the idea of a great city?
- What can we learn from the poems about the challenges and opportunities in our cities?
- How did the different poems make you think about your own community in a new way?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did writing in free verse, with its flexibility and focus on vivid imagery, help you express your unique vision and feelings about sustainable cities and communities?
- What did you learn about the power of vivid imagery and sensory details in making a poem about urban challenges or opportunities feel real and impactful?
- Did the process of crafting your free verse poem change your perspective about how poetry can communicate complex social and environmental issues like those in Global Goal 11?
- What do these activities tell us about how we can all work towards Global Goal 11?
- What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to help build a better, more sustainable community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, the individual writing process, and active participation in discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of sustainable cities (inclusive, safe, resilient), as demonstrated through the thematic content and symbolism within the free verse poem(s) and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying free verse elements. Look for imagery and detail (does the poem use vivid words and sensory details to create a picture?), impactful language (are there strong verbs and purposeful word choices?), and connection to Global Goal 11 (does the poem clearly connect to an idea about cities and communities?).
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussion.

## **Unlocking the Flow with Stream of Consciousness Writing for Global Goal 4**
**(30-60 MINUTES)**  
**Materials**  
Paper or notebooks

**Introduction**  
	Introduce the concept of “stream of consciousness” writing

* A free flowing style where thoughts and feelings are expressed without censorship or editing. This technique can help us access our deeper thoughts and emotions.

	Connect the idea of unfiltered thought to learning. Ask questions like:

* Have you ever had an idea pop into your head during class that you were too afraid to share?  
* How might ‘stream of consciousness’ writing help us explore our own thoughts and feelings about education?

**Prompt Selection: From Targets to Thoughts**  
	Divide students into groups or have them work individually, assigning each a specific Global Goal 4 Target.  
	Have each student/group focus on their assigned target and brainstorm related themes and issues.

**Free Writing**  
	Create a calm and focused environment, possibly with soft music or nature sounds playing in the background.  
	Instruct students to write continuously for a set amount of time (e.g., 10-15 minutes) without editing or censoring their thoughts (censoring within appropriate limits for the classroom).  
	Encourage students to keep their assigned target in mind and let their ideas and thoughts flow freely, exploring their personal connections, experiences, and ideas related to the topic.  
**Sharing and Connecting**  
	Create a safe space for students to share excerpts from their writing, emphasizing that they don’t have to share anything they’re not comfortable with.  
	Encourage active listening and respectful responses.  
	As a class, identify common themes, emotions, and ideas that emerge from the writing.  
Examples of questions to open the discussion:

* "What common threads or patterns did you notice in the writing shared today?"  
* "Were there any specific emotions that came up repeatedly in the stories?"  
* "Did anyone identify recurring obstacles or challenges to education in the writing?"  
* "What aspirations or dreams for the future did you hear expressed in the stories?"  
* "Can we group any of these ideas together under broader themes?"

Discuss how the students’ personal reflections and ideas connect to the broader goals of quality education and lifelong learning for all.

* "How do the personal experiences and reflections in these stories relate to the idea of 'quality education for all'?"  
* "Did any of the stories highlight specific barriers to education that Global Goal 4 aims to address?"  
* "What potential solutions or actions did you hear in the writing that align with the targets of Global Goal 4?"  
* "How do these stories illustrate the importance of lifelong learning and its impact on individuals and communities?"  
* "In what ways can we, as students, contribute to achieving the goals of quality education and lifelong learning for all?"

**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did the stream-of-consciousness writing process feel for you? Was it challenging, liberating, or something else entirely?  
* Did allowing your thoughts to flow freely without censorship reveal any unexpected connections or insights about education?  
* What emotions or memories surfaced as you wrote about Global Goal 4?  
* Did this style of writing help you access deeper or more personal feelings about education that you might not normally consider?  
* What new perspectives on Global Goal 4 emerged from your stream of consciousness writing?  
* Did exploring your personal experiences and thoughts connect you to the broader global issues surrounding quality education? If so, how?  
* How did the diverse personal reflections shared today highlight the multifaceted nature of “quality education for all”?  
* Did this activity change your understanding of the urgency or importance of achieving Global Goal 4?  
* Did the stream of consciousness writing process spark any new ideas about how you might advocate for quality education in your own community or beyond?  
* How can understanding your own thoughts or feelings about education inform your actions and contributions towards achieving Global Goal 4?  
* What role do you think personal narratives and individual experiences play in raising awareness and inspiring change on a global scale?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial brainstorming, understanding stream of consciousness techniques, the individual writing process, and active participation in discussions (including sharing if applicable).  
* Comprehension of Global Goal 4 and its targets and core concepts (e.g., access, equity, quality, lifelong learning). This will be evidenced through the thematic content and emotional depth of the stream of consciousness writing and verbal explanations.  
* Originality and effectiveness in applying stream of consciousness writing, demonstrating an ability to let thoughts flow freely while still exploring the chosen topic and engaging with the concept of unfiltered expression.  
* How clearly and powerfully the finished writing piece communicates its intended message about education. Did the writing successfully evoke thought or emotion in the reader/listener?  
* Ability to explore personal connections, experiences, or imagined scenarios related to the education target, demonstrated empathy and a broadened perspective.  
* Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of unfiltered writing in self-discovery and understanding complex social issues.  
* New insights gained by students about themselves, education, or Global Goal 4, as articulated in reflections.

Create slips of paper with various themes for each group (examples below).  
Optional: Gather simple props for the Tableau Vivant exercise, such as chairs, tables, scarves/blankets/cloth, cardboard, books, pens/pencils, bowls/plates/signs.  
Example of how to explain to students: "Okay everyone, now we're going to do an activity called Tableau Vivant. It's a fancy French term that means 'living picture.' Basically, you'll be working in small groups to create a frozen scene – like a photograph – using your bodies and facial expressions. Your tableau will represent a specific aspect of poverty or resilience. Think of it as a silent way to tell a story or express an emotion. You can use any props you can find in the classroom to help you create your tableau. The goal is to make your message clear and powerful without using any words."  
***Group Assignments***  
	Divide students into small groups.  
Assign each group a theme, ensuring a balance of both challenging and empowering topics. Here are some examples:

* Challenging themes:   
  * A family struggling to find shelter   
  * A child unable to attend school due to poverty   
  * A person experiencing discrimination due to their socioeconomic status.  
* Empowering themes:   
  * A community coming together to support a homeless individual   
  * A student overcoming poverty through education and hard work   
  * An activist fighting for economic justice.

***Presentation***  
Give each group 5-10 minutes to create their tableau. Encourage them to use their bodies, facial expressions, and any props available (e.g., chairs, scarves).  
Have each group present their tableau to the class while remaining silent.  
Invite the audience to observe and interpret the tableau, writing down their thoughts and feelings.  
After each presentation, ask the group to explain their tableau and the message they intended to convey. Encourage them to share their artistic choices and how they relate to the theme of poverty or resilience  
Facilitate a brief discussion after each tableau, inviting the audience to share their interpretations and ask questions (based on what they wrote down).  
	**Tips:**

* Emphasize the importance of empathy and respect throughout both activities.  
* Provide ample time for students to express their thoughts and feelings.  
* Encourage creativity and allow students to explore different perspectives.  
* Use open-ended questions to foster deeper reflection and understanding.


  
**Reflection and Summary**  
Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.  
Ask guiding questions like:

* How did creating a "living picture" help you understand the chosen aspect of poverty or resilience on a deeper level?  
* What did you learn about the power of nonverbal communication to convey complex emotions and social issues?  
* What were some of the challenges in communicating your theme effectively without using words?  
* How did the process of creating a static image, compared to a moving performance, affect your understanding of the issue?  
* What did you notice about the impact of the tableaux on the audience? What emotions or thoughts did it evoke?  
* What different interpretations did you observe from the audience, and how did they compare to your group's intended message?  
* Did seeing the other groups' tableaux broaden your understanding of the many facets of poverty and resilience?  
* How did the different themes presented by each group connect to create a larger picture of the issue?  
* What did you learn about the importance of perspective and empaty in understanding the experiences of others?  
* How did the act of creating a tableau shift your perspective on poverty or resilience compared to simply reading or talking about it?  
* Did any of the tableaux resonate with you on a personal level, perhaps connecting to your own feelings or experiences?  
* What did you learn about the strength and dignity of individuals facing poverty through this activity?  
* How might the experience of creating or witnessing these "living pictures' influence your willingness to take action to address poverty?  
* What kind of message about poverty and resilience do you think could be effectively conveyed through tableau vivant to a wider audience?  
* What role do you see for creative expression, like drama, in advocating for social change adn addressing issues like poverty?

**Assessment**

* Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial image/video discussions, brainstorming themes, group tableau creation, and sharing sessions.

* How clearly and powerfully the tableau communicated its intended message without words. Did the tableau successfully evoke thought or emotion in the audience?  
* Ability to work effectively within the small groups, contributing ideas, respecting diverse interpretations, and collaborating cohesively to create the tableau.  
* Ability to observe other groups' tableaux critically and empathetically, offering thoughtful interpretations and asking insightful questions during the discussion phase.

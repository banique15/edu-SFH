## The Earth’s Voice: Life on Land & Prose
**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers

A small bag or box/container containing “story starters” - objects that represent different parts of a land ecosystem (e.g., a small pinecone, a fake butterfly, a small toy frog, a twisted piece of brown string to represent a root, a toy shovel, a fake plant leaf, etc.) 

	Should have items that represent: Life/Growth, Struggle/Decay, Hope/Healing

**Introduction**

	Begin by introducing the concept of a prose poem. Explain that it’s a type of writing that looks like a story (with sentences and paragraphs), but feels like a poem. It’s a way to paint a picture with words and make the reader feel an emotion. The magic of a prose poem is that it has the rhythm and beautiful language of poetry, but the freedom of a story.

	Share a simple, accessible example:

- [*Don’t Bother the Earth Spirit*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/101675/dont-bother-the-earth-spirit-who-lives-here)*,*
  Joy Harjo
- [*The Fall*](http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/russell_edson/poems/14919)*,*
  Russell Edson
- [*How I Go to the Woods*](https://www.uuworld.org/articles/two-prose-poems)*,*

  Bethany F. Brengan
- [*Tale of the Tortoise*](https://www.juxtaprosemagazine.org/tale-of-the-tortoise-by-bruce-weigl/)*,*
  Bruce Weigl

	After reading the example, ask students what they noticed with guiding questions like:

- Did it feel like a regular story?
- Did it feel like a poem?

	Point out any descriptive words, the focus on feelings, and the rhythm of the sentences.

	Introduce Global Goal 15: Life On Land. Explain that the land, just like the ocean, is home to incredible ecosystems and animals. This goal is all about protecting those homes, from the tallest mountains to the smallest patch of soil. Tell students that their job today is to write a prose poem that gives a voice to a part of this land.

**The Land’s Story Bag Brainstorm**

	Tell the class that they will participate in a hands-on brainstorming activity that will provide them with the ingredients for their upcoming prose poems.

	Place the story starters bag/container at the front of the room/easily accessible place.

	*The Land’s Beginning*

- Take out an object or objects that represents Life/Growth, such as a small leaf, a seed, a pinecone, a fake butterfly, or a flower. Explain that this object represents a healthy, thriving ecosystem.
- Ask students to imagine themselves as detectives, and prompt them with guiding questions like:
  - What kind of land would this item live in?
  - What would you see in that place?
  - What would you hear?
  - What would it smell like?
  - What would it feel like to be there?
- Have students share their ideas, and write them on the whiteboard/large paper under the heading “The Healthy Land.” This starts a shared bank of words.

	*The Missing Piece*

- Prompt students to imagine that one type of plant or animal is in danger and disappears from the ecosystem the class just created. Ask guiding questions like:
  - What would that look like in our art?
  - How would this affect our ecosystem?
- Ask a few students to deliberately remove items from the art piece, creating an empty space.
- Ask students how the art piece looks now. Does it look full and healthy, or like there is a missing piece?

	*The Restoration*

- Prompt students to show how we can help heal the ecosystem, asking guiding questions like:
  - What can we do to help restore a missing piece of the puzzle?
  - What kinds of things can people do to help nature heal?
- Invite a new group of students to add items back or add new ones to fill in the empty spaces. Ask each student to talk about their “action” when they add an item.
  - Examples: 
    - “’m putting this flower here to show how we can plant new things.”
    - “’m adding this group of leaves to show how we can help a group of animals have a home again.”

	This activity turns the abstract concept of biodiversity into a visual, hands-on puzzle that students can create and fix.

**Writing Our Prose Poems**

	Have students use the words from the brainstorm/writer’s toolbox to help create their own prose poems.

- *Choosing a Story:* Encourage students to choose one part of the story just brainstormed (the healthy land, the challenge, or the hope) and write about it.
- *Using Our Tools:* Remind students to use a variety of sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch) to bring their scene to life. Instruct students to focus on strong verbs and descriptive words.

	Walk around the room and offer guidance. Offer help if needed with guiding questions like:

- If this tree could talk, what would it say?
- What sounds would you hear in this place?
- What would this situation feel like as the small animal who makes this place its home?
- What sounds would you hear in this place?

**Small Group Story Sharing**

	When the writing is finished, divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Each student will share their prose poem by reading it aloud. 

	When all students in the group have shared their poems, open a discussion for students to have within each group. Ask guiding questions like:

- What stories did you hear in these poems?
- What words or images stood out to you the most?
- How did these poems make you feel?
- How do these poems connect to Global Goal 15?

	If desired and time allows, you can ask a few volunteers to share their favorite poem or parts of a poem with the whole class.

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using the freedom of a prose poem help you express your feelings about life on land?
- Why is it important to make people feel something about an issue like deforestation, desertification, etc.?
- What did you learn about the importance of giving a voice to the land?
- What is one thing you can do to help a natural place in your own community?
- How did this lesson change the way you think about stories and poems?
- Do you think you’ll notice more details about the natural world now?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the brainstorm, independent writing, small group sharing and discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 15 and the concept of prose poetry. This is shown by the thematic content of the poems and the ability to explain the message.
- Originality and effectiveness in using poetic language within a prose format. Were strong, descriptive words and sensory details used to bring the story to life?
- How clearly and powerfully the prose poems communicate the intended message. Did the poems successfully evoke thoughts or emotions related to life on land?
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups, listening to each other’s poems and providing thoughtful feedback.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of art in social change and the complexities of life on land.

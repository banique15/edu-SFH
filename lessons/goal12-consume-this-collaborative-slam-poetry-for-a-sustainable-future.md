Facilitate a brief discussion.

- What are your initial impressions of slam poetry?
- How does it differ from traditional poetry?
- What makes slam poetry so engaging and impactful?

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, and emphasize its importance in achieving a sustainable future.

Explain that all groups will be working together to explore Global Goal 12 as a whole.

Facilitate a discussion about the interconnectedness of the targets within Global Goal 12:

- How do issues like food waste, resource depletion, and corporate responsibility relate to each other?
- How does our individual consumption impact global production patterns?
- What are the systemic changes needed to achieve sustainable consumption and production?

Provide a brief overview of key themes and concerns addressed by Global Goal 12:

- Waste reduction and recycling.
- Efficient use of natural resources.
- Sustainable business practices.
- Consumer awareness and education.
- Policy and government action.

Connect slam poetry and Global Goal 12 by engaging students in a thought-provoking discussion about how slam poetry can be used to explore themes of consumption and production. Ask questions like

- How can the raw emotion and energy of slam poetry capture the urgency of the environmental crisis?
- Can slam poetry challenge listeners to rethink their relationship with material goods and the systems of production that create them?
- How can spoken word be a powerful tool for raising awareness and inspiring action for sustainable change?
- How can we use slam poetry to give voice to the planet, to marginalized communities, or to future generations?

**Exploring Slam Poetry Techniques and Collaborative Brainstorming**

Demonstrate and discuss key slam poetry techniques that students can incorporate into their writing:

- *Personal Narrative:* Sharing personal experiences related to consumption, waste, or sustainability.
- *Social Commentary:* Critiquing unsustainable practices, corporate greed, or government inaction.
- *Imagery and Metaphor:* Using vivid language and figurative language to create powerful visuals and evoke emotions.
- *Rhythm and Rhyme:* Employing rhythm, rhyme, repetition, and alliteration to create a musical flow and emphasize key points.
- *Call and Response:* Engaging the audience with questions or refrains.
- *Performance Elements:* Using voice modulation, body language, and stage presence to enhance the impact of the poem.

Groups brainstorm together to develop a single slam poem that addresses Global Goal 12. Encourage students to:

- Identify key themes and messages related to responsible consumption and production.
- Brainstorm different perspectives and voices to include in the poem (e.g., a consumer, a worker, a scientist, the planet).
- Explore different ways to structure the poem (e.g., a narrative, an argument, a call to action).
- Divide the poem into sections or stanzas that can be performed by different group members.
- Explore different ways to incorporate each group member’s voice and style.

Examples of thematic approaches:

- A poem that traces the lifecycle of a product, from resource extraction to disposal, with different group members voicing different stages.
- A poem that contrasts unsustainable and sustainable lifestyles, with different members embodying each approach.
- A poem taht critiques the influence of advertising on consumer behavior, with different members taking on the roles of advertising and consumers.
- A poem that calls for systemic change in production and consumption patterns, with different members highlighting specific solutions (e.g., circular economy, renewable energy, policy reform).
- A poem that explores the personal and emotional impact of the climate crisis, connecting individual actions to global consequences.

Groups create a basic outline or structure for their collaborative slam poem, assigning sections or roles to different members.

**Collaborative Poem Writing and Rehearsal**

Groups work together to write their slam poem, with each member contributing. Emphasize:

- Clear communication and active listening within the group.
- Respectful sharing of ideas and constructive feedback.
- Building upon each other’s language, imagery, and rhythm.
- Creating a cohesive flow and tone throughout the poem.
- Ensuring each group member has a meaningful and impactful part to perform that they are comfortable with.
- The importance of creating a shared vision and working towards a common goal.

Circulate to provide guidance, facilitate collaboration, and help resolve any issues when needed.

Groups rehearse their poems collaboratively, focusing on:

- Smooth transitions between different sections and performers.
- Coordinated vocal delivery, rhythm, and pacing.
- Effective use of group dynamics.
- Ensuring each member feels confident, prepared, and supported by their group.
- Practicing eye contact, gestures, and other performance elements to connect with the audience.

Provide constructive feedback on both the writing and the performance as a group, offering specific suggestions for improvement.

**Collaborative Poem Performances**

Groups perform their collaborative slam poems for the class. Encourage:

- A sense of collective energy, shared purpose, and mutual support.
- Clear, engaging, and powerful delivery from each performer.
- Effective use of group dynamics and staging to create a visually and emotionally compelling performance.

Facilitate a supportive and encouraging environment, celebrating the groups’ efforts and achievements.

After each performance, the class offers positive feedback and constructive criticism, focusing on:

- The effectiveness of the poem as a whole, including its message, structure, and impact.
- The collaboration, coordination, and energy of the performers as a group.
- The use of slam poetry techniques and performance elements.

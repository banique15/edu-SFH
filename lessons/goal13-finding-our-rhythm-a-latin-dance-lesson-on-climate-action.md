**Introduction**

`	`Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and creativity to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 13, Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

`	`Clarify that Global Goal 13 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to work together to protect our planet. Emphasize that this means:

- *Fighting climate change:* Working to keep the Earth healthy and safe.
- *Finding solutions:* Creating new and smart ways to power our world and live our lives.
- *Protecting our communities:* Making sure our towns and cities are strong enough to handle big storms and other weather challenges.

`	`Introduce Latin dance as a powerful art form that is celebrated around the world. Clarify that Latin dance is energetic, joyful, and is often done in groups, which helps build a sense of community. Explain that the class will use the rhythm, energy, and community of Latin dance to tell stories about climate change and how we can find solutions together.

**Warm Up: The Rhythm of Resilience**

`	`Explain that the students will explore how music and movement can express two different feelings: chaos and resilience.

`	`Play Latin music of your choice, that will fit well with the below activity.

`	`Examples:

- “[La Vida Es Un Carnaval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ho86ggAVrY)” Celia Cruz
- “[Suavemente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiEbYSF9kE)” Elvis Crespo

`	`*Chaos Rhythm:*

- Instruct students to move their bodies in a way that expresses a feeling of chaos.
- While students are moving, prompt and ask guiding questions like:
  - This is what it might feel like when a big storm or disaster hits our community.
    - What does that look like in your body?
    - Is it a jerky movement?
    - Is it a shaking movement?

`	`*Resilience Rhythm*

- Then instruct students to transition their movements from chaos to resilience. 
- While students are moving, prompt and ask guiding questions like:
  - This is what it feels like when our community comes together to rebuild and support each other.
    - What does that look like in your body?
    - Is it a strong movement?
    - Is it a grounded movement?

`	`*The Transition*

- Instruct students to transition between the two rhythms, moving from a feeling of chaos to a feeling of resilience. This transition will help prepare them for the emotional storytelling of the main activity.

`	`Conclude warm up by affirming the expressive abilities and transitions, explaining that they will use these contrasting feelings to tell stories about climate action.

**Climate Story Movement Brainstorm** 

`	`Explain that the students will create a Climate Story Movement brainstorm to get their minds and bodies thinking about how to represent Global Goal 13 in dance and movement.

`	`Instruct students to find a comfortable space and think about the following two ideas, creating a simple, individual post or gesture for each one.

- *Pose 1, A Climate Challenge*
  - Ask students to think of one climate challenge they’ve heard about or experienced. Then, ask them to think about a simple pose or gesture that they could use to show that challenge.
  - Give students a few moments to think about their climate challenge and movement.
- *Post 2, A Climate Solution*
  - Now, ask students to think of one way the we can take action to help the planet. This can be specific to their challenge or a larger, holistic action. Ask them to think about a simple, strong post or gesture that shows that solution.
  - Give students a few moments to think about their climate solution and movement.

`	`Have students quickly and quietly perform their two poses, first the challenge and then the solution. 

`	`Have a few students share their poses with the class. This will begin to give students a movement vocabulary and connect their own ideas to Global Goal 13.

**Choreography and Rehearsal**

`	`Explain that the class will now learn a series of simple Latin dance steps that, when put together, will tell a story about climate change. Clarify that each step will represent a different part of the story, from a challenge to a solution, just like the poses they just created.

`	`Choose a song for the class dance that they will learn, practice, and perform to.

`	`Examples:

- “[Quimbara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAq9y0bxTX0)” Celia Cruz
- “[Vivir Mi Vida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXnjy5YlDwk)” Marc Anthony
- “[La Bilirrubina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8PpV3yK5iA)” Juan Luis Guerra
- “[A Pedir Su Mano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIW2y76C7r0)” Juan Luis Guerra
- “[La Pollera Colorá](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYG7tdlYluo)” Charlie Zaa
- “[Cumbia Cienaguera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFAN5JVOTkI)” Luis Carlos Meyer

`	`Emphasize:

- Clear instructions, repetition, and a supportive learning environment.
- Focus on the feeling and intention behind the movement, not just the technical execution.

`	`Guide students through the following steps, which together tell a story about a community facing and overcoming a climate challenge:

- *Step 1, The Challenge (Cumbia Side-to-Side):* Teach a simple side-to-side step. Explain that this represents a community facing a challenge, moving slowly and cautiously.
  - [HOW TO](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=ac435d3c33422e6e&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&udm=7&q=Cumbia+steps+for+beginners&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRz9_Z6ZePAxWg5ckDHQx6NqMQ1QJ6BAgbEAE&biw=1327&bih=629&dpr=2#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:9aece4eb,vid:smTHJxHunA0,st:35)
- *Step 2, The Action (Merengue March):* Teach a simple marching step with a hip movement. Explain that this represents the community taking action, marching with determination to find a solution.

- *Step 3, The Solution (Salsa Turn):* Teach a simple salsa turn. Explain that this represents the moment a solution is found, a sudden change or a breakthrough.
  - [HOW TO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBi4ITgMUAU&t=51s)
- *Step 4, The Celebration (Salsa Basic):* Teach a simple salsa basic step. Explain that this represents the community celebrating their success, moving together with joy and energy.

`		`NOTE: Step 3 and 4 should be taught together, see how to video for more information.

`	`Have students practice each step individually and then with a partner or in a group. Connect the movements to the feelings of the climate story (e.g., a heavy, slow step for a challenge, a fast, light step for a solution).

`	`Lead the class through multiple run-throughs of the full dance, both with and without music, to help students feel comfortable with the steps and the story they are telling. Give positive feedback and encouragement after each run-through.

**Performance and Observation**

`	`Split the class in half. The first half will perform the dance, and the second will be the audience, observing to identify the Global Goal 13 story being told.

`	`Guide the class to a formation where the two halves can clearly see each other.
*
`	`Instruct the first half of the class to perform the dance from beginning to end (with guidance if needed). Instruct the second half to watch for how the dance shows:

- *The Climate Challenge:* What movements in the dance showed a problem?
- *The Climate Action:* What movements showed people working hard to find a solution?
- *The Climate Solution:* What movements showed the solution and a happy, hopeful ending?
*
`	`Have the groups switch places. The first half will now be the audience, and the second will perform. Ask the new audience to observe the same three things.

`	`After both performances, lead a discussion, asking guiding questions like:

- What did you notice about how the dance’s movements changed from the challenge part to the solution part?
- Which movements do you think were the most powerful in telling the story of climate action?
- Did the dance make you feel like everyone working together can make a difference?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did learning and performing the Latin dance steps help you connect with the urgency and themes of climate action on a more embodied level?
- What did you learn about how rhythm, energy, and shared movement can express concepts like resilience, adaptation, or collective progress in the face of climate change?
- Did the activities spark any new emotions or insights about climate challenges or solutions that you might not have gained from reading or discussing them?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 13 and the importance of urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts through this dance exploration?
- What is one key takeaway about climate action and the power of creative expression and movement that you will remember from this lesson?
- What’s one small action you feel inspired to take this week to contribute to a healthier planet?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, learning basic Latin dance steps, the choreography, performance, and class discussions.

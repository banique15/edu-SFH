**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to Speculative Fiction. Explain that it’s a genre that explores possibilities beyond the reality we know.

Highlight its key characteristics:

- Imagining alternative futures, worlds, or societies.
- Exploring “what if” scenarios.
- Addressing social, political, and ethical issues through fictional lenses.
- Encompassing genres like science fiction, fantasy, dystopian, utopian, and climate fiction (cli-fi).

Share short excerpts from diverse speculative fiction texts, focusing on:

- Different subgenres and their approaches.
- The power of speculative fiction to raise awareness and spark critical thinking.

Examples:

- “The Water Knife” by Paolo Bacigalupi 
  - This excerpt sets the stage for water scarcity and social tension in the novel. It immediately establishes the stakes and the harsh reality of a climate-changed world. It’s engaging and introduces a morally complex character. It connects to Global Goal 13 by showing a potential consequence of inaction.

`	`"Angel Velasquez was a water knife, and that meant he was a scavenger. He worked for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, and most days his job was simple: find water, open the tap, and make sure that the water kept flowing south. But some days, like today, it meant something else. It meant cutting off someone else's water. Turning off the tap. Making sure that someone else went dry. And those were the days when people died. The water wars had been going on for years. State against state, city against city, neighbor against neighbor. It was a slow-motion apocalypse, a parched and desperate unraveling of the West. And Angel was one of its harbingers."

- “Parable of the Sower” by Octavia E. Butler
  - This excerpt gives a sense of the social breakdown and environmental degradation in Butler’s near-future California. It is powerful and evocative. It highlights the social justice dimensions of climate change.

"The world is changing. You can feel it in the air. You can see it in the streets. You can smell it in the smoke. The government's gone. The rich are walled in, and the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves. It's a war out there. A slow, grinding war of attrition. The Earth is dying, and we're dying with it."

- “Flight Behavior” by Barbara Kingsolver
  - This excerpt introduces the central myster of the novel, the appearance of monarch butterflies in an unexpected location, and hints at the underlying climate change cause.

"Dellarobia had come to think of the mountain as her own personal problem. She was accustomed to the way things changed up there. The way the trees changed color, the way the light changed. But this was different. This was… wrong. The mountain was on fire. Not in the way of a forest fire, with flames and smoke. But in a different way. It was as if the trees themselves had turned into fire. The trees were full of butterflies."

- “The Ministry for the Future” by Kim Stanley Robinson
  - This excerpt conveys the urgency of the climate crisis.

"The CO2 was still accumulating in the sky; the temperature was still rising; the ice was still melting; the sea was still rising; the weather was still changing; the storms were still raging; the droughts were still spreading; the fires were still burning; the people were still suffering; the species were still going extinct. And the only thing that was changing fast enough to keep up with the rate of all that was the rate of human denial."

Facilitate a brief discussion:

- What are some examples of speculative fiction you’re familiar with?
- What makes speculative fiction so compelling and thought provoking?
- How can speculative fiction help us explore complex issues like climate change?

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

Emphasize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action. Briefly review targets and indicators if wanted.

Engage students in a thought-provoking discussion about how speculative fiction can be used to explore climate change. Ask questions like:

- How can we use speculative fiction to visualize the potential consequences of climate change?
- Can speculative fiction empower us to take action and advocate for change?

**Exploring Speculative Fiction Techniques and Brainstorming**

Demonstrate and discuss key speculative fiction techniques that students can incorporate into their writing:

- *World-building:* Creating detailed and believable future worlds affected by climate change.
- *Character development:* Exploring how individuals and communities adapt (or fail to adapt) to climate change.
- *Plot and conflict:* Developing storylines that revole around climate-related challenges and solutions.
- *Scientific extrapolation:* Basing fictional storylines that revolve around climate-related challenges and solutions.
- *Social commentary:* Using fiction to critique current policies, behaviors, or societal structures.

Each student brainstorms ideas for a short speculative fiction story (1-3 pages) that addresses Global Goal 13. Encourage students to:

- Choose a specific climate change impact or solution to focus on.
- Develop a compelling setting, characters, and plot.
- Incorporate elements of scientific extrapolation and social commentary.
- Consider the emotional impact of their story.

Examples of speculative fiction concepts:

- **Target 13.1** *(Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity)*
  - A story about a community that builds innovative and resilient infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events.
  - A story about a group of climate refugees forced to migrate due to rising sea levels or desertification.
- **Target 13.2** *(Integrate climate change measures)*
  - A story set in a future where climate change measures are fully integrated into national policies and daily life.
  - A dystopian story about a society where climate change is ignored, leading to social collapse and environmental devastation.
- **Target 13.3** *(Improve education and awareness)*
  - A story about a young person who uses technology and storytelling to educate their community about climate change.
  - A story that explores the challenges of communicating climate science and overcoming misinformation.
- **Target 13.a** *(Mobilize finance)*
  - A story about a global initiative to fund climate adaptation projects in developing countries.
  - A story that critiques the financial barriers to climate action and the role of economic inequality.
- **Target 13.b** *(Promote mechanisms for capacity-building)*
  - A story about a program that empowers women, youth, and marginalized communities to participate in climate change planning and management.
  - A story that explores the importance of indigenous knowledge and traditional practices in climate adaptation.

Students develop a basic outline or plot summary for their speculative fiction story.

**Story Writing**

Students write their speculative fiction stories, incorporating the techniques and concepts discussed. Encourage students to:

- Create vivid and detailed descriptions of their future world.
- Develop compelling and relatable characters.
- Craft a plot that is engaging and thought-provoking.
- Use strong language and imagery to convey their message.
- Explore the ethical and social dimensions of climate change.

Provide guidance, support, and feedback as needed.

**Sharing and Discussion**

If time allows, students share their stories with the class (either by reading full story, excerpts, or summarizing the plot). Students can also read each other’s stories as another way to share.

Facilitate a discussion either after each story or after all stories have been shared. Ask questions like:

- What climate change issues or solutions did the story(ies) explore?
- How did the author(s) use speculative fiction techniques to convey their message?
- What impact could this story have on readers’ understanding of climate change?
- What did you learn about the power of storytelling to inspire action?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did writing a speculative fiction story about climate change help you explore potential futures, both challenging and hopeful, in a way that non-fiction might not?
- What did you learn about the power of world-building, character development, and plot to make complex issues like climate change feel more personal and urgent?
- Did creating a fictional scenario about climate change open your mind to new possibilities or solutions you hadn’t considered before?
- How can imagining a future (whether dystopian or utopian) influence our actions in the present regarding climate change?
- What role do you think storytelling plays in raising awareness and inspiring action about global challenges?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 13 and the importance of urgent action to combat climate change through this creative writing exploration?
- How did your story, and those shared by your classmates, highlight the interconnectedness of different aspects of climate action (e.g., adaptation, mitigation, education, finance)?
- What common themes of powerful messages about humanity’s response to climate change emerged across the different stories you heard?
- How can speculative fiction help us to visualize climate data or scientific projections in a more human and engaging way?
- Did creating your speculative fiction story spark any personal connections or reflections on your own impact on the environment or your feelings about the climate crisis?
- What emotions did you connect with while writing your story, and how might those emotions motivate you to take action related to Global Goal 13?
- What is one key takeaway about climate action and the power of imagination that you will remember from this lesson?
- What is a specific action, big or small, that you feel inspired to take after this lesson to contribute to achieving Global Goal 13?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the introduction to speculative fiction, technique discussions, the individual writing process, and active participation in discussions (including sharing stories if applicable).
- Comprehension of Global Goal 13, targets and core concepts. This will be evidenced through the narrative, thematic content, and symbolism within the speculative fiction story and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying chosen speculative fiction elements (e.g., world-building, character development, plot, scientific extrapolation, social commentary) to convey the message about climate change.
- How clearly and powerfully the finished speculative fiction story communicates its intended message about  Global Goal 13. Did the narrative successfully evoke thought or emotion in the audience, or effectively explore a climate challenge/solution?
- Quality of the writing craft, including vivid imagery, sensory details, strong verbs, and the creation of atmosphere, demonstrating attention to narrative impact.
- Ability to articulate creative choices and to interpret and provide thoughtful feedback on classmates’ stories, connecting them to Global Goal 13 themes.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of storytelling in advocating for climate action and the complexities of climate futures.

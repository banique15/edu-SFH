**Learning About the Folk Dance**  
	Share the origin and cultural context of the chosen folk dance.

* Dance and cultural traditions contribute to a sense of identity and belonging which are key components of mental and social well being.

	Show images or videos of the dance being performed, highlighting key movements and formations.

* The physicality of the dance \- its energy, rhythm, and patterns \- can promote physical fitness and coordination, contributing to overall health.

	Discuss any symbolism or meaning behind the dance steps, costumes, or music.

* These elements reflect cultural values and beliefs related to health, healing, and community celebrations.

	Explain the cultural significance of the dance and its role in the community.

* Dance can bring people together, fostering social connections and a sense of belonging, which are important for health and well being.

**Warm-up and Movement Exploration**  
	Lead students through a gentle warm-up, incorporating stretches and simple movements inspired by the chosen folk dances. Examples:

* *Circle Stretches:* Have students form a circle, holding hands. Gentlys way side to side, mimicking the swaying motion often seen in folk dances. Then, raise arms overhead and reach for the sky, feeling a stretch in the sides of the body.  
* *Footwork Prep:* With feet shoulder-width apart, practice stepping side to side, then add a heel-toe tap in front. This mimics basic steps seen in dances like Irish jigs or the Kolo.  
* *Grapevine:* Teach the basic grapevine step (step side, cross behind, step side) and have students practice it moving across the room. This is a common step in various folk dances.  
* *Partnered Folk Dances:* In pairs, students face each other and gently swing their joined hands back and forth, or try a simple do-si-do (passing each other right shoulder to right shoulder, then back to back, then left to left). This warms up the body and builds connection for partnered folk dances

	Play examples of the music that will accompany the chosen dance to familiarize students with the rhythms and styles.  
**Learning Basic Steps**  
	Break down the basic steps and patterns of the folk dance, demonstrating them clearly and slowly.

* Encourage students to focus on their body awareness and coordination, highlighting the benefits of physical activity for overall health.

	Provide opportunities for students to practice the steps individually and in pairs, and potentially in a group.

* Emphasize the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and mutual support, key aspects of social well-being.

	Offer modifications or variations if needed.  
	Use positive reinforcement and encouragement to create a fun and inclusive learning environment.

* Celebrate the joy of movement and the positive impact it can have on health and well being.

**Connecting Dance to Global Goal 3**  
	Divide students into three groups.

* Each group will focus one one aspect of well being: Physical, Mental/Emotional, and Social.

	Guide the groups to analyze how the folk dance they learned connects to their assigned aspect of well-being.

* *Physical:* Focus on muscle groups used, energy expenditure, balance/coordination required.  
* *Mental/Emotional:* Discuss the mood of the music, any symbolism in the steps, and how the dance makes them feel.  
* *Social:* Examine how the dance structure (partnering, group formations, etc.) promotes connection, and how learning a dance from another culture fosters understanding.

**Creative Expression and Performance**  
	Each group will create a short movement phrase (30-60 seconds) highlighting their assigned well-being aspect, using elements from the folk dance.  
	Groups can add their own flair, change the music tempo, or use levels (high/low) to further express the theme.

**Introduction**

`	`Welcome students to an exciting creative writing class. Explain that they will use their words and imagination to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 13, Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

`	`Clarify that Global Goal 13 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to work together to protect our planet. Emphasize that this means:

- *Fighting climate change:* Working to keep the Earth healthy and safe.
- *Finding solutions:* Creating new and smart ways to power our world and live our lives.
- *Protecting our communities:* Making sure our towns and cities are strong enough to handle big storms and other weather challenges.

`	`Introduce Speculative Fiction. Explain that speculative fiction is a type of story that asks “What if?” Clarify that these are stories that imagine a world that is different from our own, whether in the future, in a magical land, or with a cool new invention. Tell students that “what if” stories are a powerful way to think about a problem, imagine a solution, and explore a whole new world.

`	`Begin by sharing a compelling image or short video clip related to a climate challenge or solution.

`	`Examples:

- [Factory Air Pollution](https://www.sciencing.com/sciencing/environmental-pollution-caused-by-factories-12071269/9453205e492449dc8a8bc4da86362dcd.jpg)
- [Animal in Wildfire](https://pamelynferdin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fire-deer-crying.jpg)
- [Cracked Earth from Drought](https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/drought-california_al-seib-los-angeles-times-getty.jpg)
- [Wind Farm](https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/t_edhub_resource_key_image/v1652340973/EducationHub/photos/wind-farm.jpg)
- [Solar Farm](https://frontend-cdn.solarreviews.com/solar-farm.jpg)
- [Eco-City](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/e/102/files/2013/08/Eco-City-6-e1432980535564.jpg)

`	`Then, show selected examples of age-appropriate speculative fiction.

`	`Examples:

- *The Lorax,* Dr. Seuss: This story is a perfect example of a challenge-solution narrative. In the book, the world has been stripped of its natural resources, but the last Truffula Seed holds the key to a better future.
  - Excerpt: “‘SO…Catch!’ calls the Once-ler. He lets something fall. ‘It’s a Truffula Seed. It’s the last one of all! You’re in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds. And the Truffula Trees are what everyone needs. Plant a new Truffula. Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack. Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.’”

- *The Giver*, Lois Lowry: This book explores a world where a community has given up color, music, and emotions in exchange for a life of “Sameness.” This excerpt shows the main character, Jonas, beginning to see color for the first time, something impossible for everyone else in his community.
  - Excerpt: “Days went by, and weeks. Jonas learned, through the memories, the names of colors; and now he began to see them all, in his ordinary life (though he knew it was ordinary no longer, and would never be again). But they didn't last. There would be a glimpse of green--the landscaped lawn around the Central Plaza; a bush on the riverbank. The bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from the agricultural fields beyond the community boundary--seen in an instant, the flash of brilliant color, but gone again, returning to their flat and hueless shade.”

- [WALL-E Finds a Plant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PEbeyUoa_I), *WALL-E*

Discuss their characteristics, asking guiding questions like:

- What is the big “What if” question in this story/clip?
- How did the author/creator imagine a world that is different from our own?
- How does this story make you feel about the planet? Do you feel hopeful, or a little worried, or maybe curious?
- What kind of new world di the author imagine? Was it a world with a problem, or a world with a great solution?

**Warm Up: Future Headlines & Feelings**

`	`Explain to students that they will practice creating short, powerful ideas by writing quick headlines about the future. This will get their brains ready for writing speculative fiction.

`	`*Give a scenario:* Provide a simple, climate-related scenario that could happen in a future world. Instruct students to quietly think about that scenario.

`	`Examples:

- A small animal has to move to a new habitat because its home became too hot.
- A family’s home is near the ocean, and they have to find a new place to live because the water level is rising.
- A city becomes so dry from a long drought that people have to find a new way to get water.
- A group of friends found a beautiful place in nature that is full of plastic trash, and they have to figure out how to clean it up.

`	`*Students write a headline and a feeling:* Instruct students to write a news-style headline for that scenario, as well as a single world that describes the feeling of the headline.

`	`Example: 

- *Scenario:* A new kind of machine is invented that cleans pollution from the air.
  - *Possible Headlines:* Air Cleaner 3000 Invented! Pollution Vanishes! Clean Air for All!
  - *Possible Feelings:* Hopeful, Excited, Proud.
- *Scenario:* A huge storm comes and floods a city.
  - *Possible Headlines:* City Covered in Water! Big Storm Causes Chaos! Where Did the City Go?
  - *Possible Feelings:* Scared, Worried, Sad.
- *Scenario:* A group of kids invents a special plant that grows in the desert.
  - *Possible Headlines:* Green Deserts Now! Magical Plant Appears! Kids Save the World!
  - *Possible Feelings:* Amazed, Happy, Excited.

`	`*Share the Headlines:* Have a few volunteers quickly share their headlines and feelings. 

Conclude warm up by affirming the creative and concise thinking, explaining that these future headlines are the start of great “what if” stories.

**The Futures We Could Have**

`	`Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a large piece of paper and markers.

`	`*The “What if…” Scenarios*

- Instruct each group to write one of the following “What if?” questions at the top of their paper:
  - What if the ice melted and the ocean got bigger? *(Challenge)*
  - What if everyone had a tiny robot to clean the air? *(Solution)*
  - What if our city was a giant garden with trees on every building? *(Hope)*
*
`		`NOTE: Feel free to come up with your own “What if?” questions, just ensure there is a Challenge/Solution/Hope option for students to choose from.

`	`*The Character and World*

- Instruct groups to brainstorm and write down words, phrases, and ideas about their “what if” scenario. Prompt them to think about:
  - *The World:* What does the world look like in this story? What’s the biggest change?
  - *The Character:* Who is the main character? What is their name? What are they worried about, or what are they excited about?
  - *The Challenge:* What is the main problem in this world? (Even in a solution or hope scenario, there’s a small problem).
  - *The Goal:* What is the character trying to do? What is their main goal?

`	`Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:

- What would a world with tiny cleaning robots look like?
- What would a character who lives in a giant garden city be worried about?
- What would your character’s day look be like?

`	`This brainstorm activity helps create a world and character for the stories.

**My Climate Action Story**

`	`Explain that each student will now choose one “what if” idea (it can be from the group’s brainstorm, or a new idea of their own) and write a speculative fiction story. Clarify that their story should be about a character in a world that is different from their own, and it should show a challenge related to climate change and how they solve it.

`	`Encourage students to:

- *Start with a “what if” idea:* Make it the core of the story.
- *Build a world:* Use vivid imagery and sensory details to describe the new world. What does it look like, sound like, feel like?
- *Create a character:* Give the character a name and a clear goal or emotion.
- *Show a turning point:* What is the moment when the problem is solved, or when hope appears?
- *Keep it short:* Focus on a single moment or a short part of a day.

`	`Provide specific writing prompts if needed, like:

- What if all the rain stopped, and a community had to get water from giant clouds?
- What if a group of kids found a magical plant that could clean all the pollution from the rivers?
- What is our school was build in a giant tree, and we had to learn to live with nature?
- What if a hero had to invent a new way to get electricity without harming the planet?

`	`Circulate, offering support and guidance as they write, asking guiding questions like:

- How can you describe your world in a way that makes it sound new and exciting?
- What is your character’s maing oal in this strange new world?
- What’s the one thing that changes in your story that solves the problem?
- Are you showing us a “what if” world with a challenge or solution?

**Sharing and Discussion**

`	`Explain that students will now share their stories. You can do this through volunteer readings, or have students pair up or form small groups to read their stories to each other.

`	`Facilitate a discussion about the stories, focusing on the connection to Global Goal 13 and the imaginative solutions. This discussion can happen with the entire class or just within groups if that is how stories were shared. Ask guiding questions like:

- What was the big “what if” in the story you heard? What was the world like?
- How did this story make you think differently about Global Goal 13 and the future of our planet?
- What was the most creative or surprising solution you heard in a story?
- What were some of the common themes (e.g., teamwork, inventions, nature saving the day) you noticed in the stories?
- How did the authors’ stories make you feel? Did you feel hopeful, worried, or inspired?
- What did you learn about the power of imagination to solve problems?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did writing a “what if” story about climate change help you explore potential futures, both challenging and hopeful, in a way that non-fiction might not?
- What did you learn about the power of imagination to make big issues like climate change feel more personal and urgent?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 13 and the importance of urgent action to combat climate change through this creative writing lesson?
- What does our “what if” activity tell us about the role of storytelling in raising awareness and inspiring action about global challenges?
- What is one key takeaway about climate action and the power of imagination that you will remember from this lesson?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, brainstorm, individual writing process, and active participation in discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of climate action (problems and solutions), as demonstrated through the narrative and thematic content of the speculative fiction story and verbal explanations.
- Originality and effectiveness in applying speculative fiction elements. Look for a clear “what if” premise (is there a clear premise about a world that is different from our own?), narrative focus (does the story have a character with a goal and a clear plot, even if short?), connection to Global Goal 13 (does the story clearly connect to ideas about climate problems or solutions?), and imaginative language (does the writing use vivid and descriptive language to bring the “what if” world to life?).
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussions.

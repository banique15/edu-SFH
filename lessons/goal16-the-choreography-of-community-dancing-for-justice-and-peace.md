**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to dance and movement as a form of expression.

- Movement is a fundamental way humans communicate and express ideas, emotions, and stories. Dance, in its many forms, harnesses this power to create meaningful experiences.
- Today, we’ll explore how different qualities of movement, like flow, force, speed, and shape, can represent abstract concepts without needing a specific style.

Briefly introduce basic movement elements accessible to beginners:

- *Flow:* Smooth, continuous movement versus sharp, abrupt movement.
- *Force/Energy:* Strong, powerful movement versus light, gentle movement.
- *Speed:* Fast tempo versus slow tempo.
- *Level:* High, medium, and low positions in space.
- *Shape:* Curved, angular, open, closed body shapes.
- *Pathways:* Straight lines, circles, spirals in space.

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Emphaisze the importance of these principles for a thriving global community.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 16:

- Reducing violence and promoting safety.
- Ending abuse and exploitiation.
- Ensuring justice and the rule of law.
- Combating corruption and organized crime.
- Building effective and inclusive institutions.
- Promoting participation and access to information.

Connect movement and Global Goal 16 by engaging students in a discussion about how dance and movement can connect to the themes of Global Goal 16.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How can flowing movements represent peace and harmony?
- Can strong, grounded movements symbolize justice and the rule of law?
- How might synchronized movements represent unity and strong institutions?
- Can contrasting movements show conflict and the need for resolution?

**Guided Movement Exploration: Embodying Goal 16**

Lead the class through a series of movement explorations, connecting different movement elements to specific themes or targets of Global Goal 16. 

Emphasize clear instructions, varied movement qualities, and inclusive language.

Examples of Movement Sequences and Global Goal 16 Connections:

- *Peace and Harmony* (Connects to Target 16.1 - Reducing Violence):
  - Let’s explore peaceful movement. Find a personal space and move with a slow, flowing quality. Let your arms and body create gentle curves and soft transitions, representing a state of calm and non-violence.
- *Justice and Fairness* (Target 16.3 - Rule of Law):
  - Let’s embody justice. Find a strong, balanced stance. Move with deliberate, grounded steps. Explore movements that show balance and equality, perhaps using your arms like scales finding equilibrium.
- *Building Strong Instititutions* (Target 16.6 - Effective Institutions):
  - Imagine building a strong structure together. Move with a sense of connection to those around you (without physical contact). Explore synchronized movements, perhaps rising and falling together, showing the coordinated effort of effective institutions.
- *Addressing Conflict* (Target 16.1 - Showing Tension and Release):
  - Let’s explore the tension of conflict. Use sharp, angular movements, perhaps moving away from others. Then, explore movements that show resolution, a gradual softening, a coming together, representing the process of finding peace.
- *Inclusivity and Participation* (Target 16.7 - Inclusive Decision Making):
  - Move around the space, acknowledging others with your eeys and gentle gestures. Explore movements that show different individuals contributing to a shared flow, representing the participation of diverse voices.
- *Transparency and Openness* (Target 16.10 - Access to Information):
  - Let’s explore movements that are open and clear. Use expansive gestures, reaching otuwards as if sharing information freely. Avoid closed or hidden movements.
- *Combating Corruption* (Target 16.5 - Showing Hidden Actions):
  - Explore movements that are small, hidden, or distorted, perhaps close to the ground. Then, contrast these with movements that are open and upright, representing the revealing of corruption.
- *Empowerment and Standing Up* (Target 16.2 - Ending Abuse):
  - Find a strong, upright posture. Explore movements that show strength and resilience, perhaps rising up from a low position. This can represent standing up against injustice and abuse.
- *Combating Organized Crime* (Target 16.6 - Showing Openness):
  - Let’s embody transparency. Use open, expansive movements, reaching outwards and showing all sides of your body. Avoid closed or secretive gestures, conveying honesty and clarity.
- *Broadening Participation* (Target 16.8 - Showing Expansion):
  - Imagine a small circle expanding to include more people. Start with a tight, contained movement, then gradually widen your gestures and pathways, reaching outwards to connect with the space and others, representing the broadening of participation.
- *Providing Legal Identity* (Target 16.9 - Showing Foundation and Growth):
  - Let’s explore the idea of establishing a legal identity. Start with a strong, grounded base. Then, explore upward movements that symbolize growth and recognition, like a plant establishing roots and reaching for the sun.

Throughout the movement sequences, provide:

- Clear and concise instructions.
- Demonstrations of movement qualities.
- Encouragement for personal interpretation.
- Connections between the movements and Global Gol 16 themes.

**Creative Movement Exploration**

After the guided sequences, encourage students to explore their own creative movement responses to Global Goal 16.

Play a diverse selection of music and invite students to:

- Combine the movement elements they’ve explored.
- Express their personal understanding and feelings about peace, justice, or specific targets of Global Goal 16 through movement.
- Focus on the qualities of movement that best convey their ideas.

Provide prompts if needed:

- How would you move to represent a world where everyone feels safe? (Target 16.1)
- Can you show the process of a community working together to build a strong institution? (Target 16.6)
- How can you express the idea of equal access to justice for all? (Target 16.3)
- How would you move to represent the feeling of being silenced or having your fundamental freedoms restricted? (Target 16.10)
- Can you show the process of a community building trust in their institutions? (Target 16.6)
- How can you physically express the idea of different countries working together in global governance? (Target 16.8)
- Show us a movement that represents the act of reporting a crime or injustice? (Target 16.3)
- How would you move to represent the concept of fairness and equitable sharing of resources? (Target 16.a, 16.b)

If a good fit for the class, call on students and have them shout out how their movement connects to Global Goal 16.

**Cool Down and Discussion**

Lead a gentle cool down to bring the energy back down and prepare for reflection.

Include stretching, deep breathing, and calming movements.

Facilitate a class discussion. Ask guiding questions like:

- What was your experience with the movement exploration?
- Which movements or themes resonated most with you?
- How did different qualities of movement help you connect with the ideas of peace and justice?
- What did you learn about your own capacity for expression and understanding of Global Goal 16?
- How can dance and movement be a tool for communication and social change?


**Reflection and Summary**

**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to Latin dance. Explain that Latin dance encompasses a variety of styles originating from Latin America and the Caribbean, each with its unique rhythms, and cultural significance.

- *Origins and Diversity:* Latin dance evolved from a blend of influences.
  - *Indigenous roots:* Many styles incorporate rhythms and movements from the dances of the native peoples of the Americas.
  - *African Heritage:* The rhythms and energy of African music and dance brought by enslaved people have had a profound impact.
  - *European influences:* Steps and forms from European ballroom and folk dances also contributed to the development of Latin dance.

This rich mix has resulted in a wide variety of styles, each with its own character.

- *Salsa:* Energetic, rhythmic, and improvisational, often associated with social dancing and nightlife.
- *Merengue:* Fast-paced, with a distinctive marching rhythm and hip action, known for its lively and fun feel.
- *Cumbia:* A slower, more rhythmic dance with African and indigenous influences, often considered a social dance.
- *Bachata:* Romantic and sensual, with a focus on close partner work and storytelling through movement.
- There are MANY more.

Rhythm is the heart of Latin dance. The music is often characterized by:

- *Strong percussion:* Drums, claves, and other percussion instruments create complex and driving rhythms.
- *Syncopation:* Accenting off-beats, creating a lively and exciting feel.
- *Call and response:* Musical phrases that are “called” and “answered,” creating a dynamic interplay.
- The music and the dance are inseparable; the movement expresses the rhythm and the feeling of the music.

Emphasize the energy, passion, and sense of community often associated with Latin dance.

Play short excerpts of different Latin dance styles, encouraging students to notice:

- The rhythmic patterns in the music.
- The energy and mood of each dance.
- The connection between the music and the movement.

Facilitate a brief discussion.

- What are your initial impressions of Latin dance?
- What emotions or feelings does this music evoke?
- How can dance be a form of expression and communication?

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. Emphasize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for collective action. Briefly review key targets and indicators if wanted.

Engage students in a thought provoking discussion about how Latin dance can be used to explore themes of climate change:

- How can the energy and passion of Latin dance represent the urgency of climate action?
- Can the rhythmic patterns and repetition in Latin music symbolize the cyclical nature of climate change impacts?
- How can the sense of community in Latin dance reflect the need for global collaboration?
- Can dance be a form of protest, celebration, or resilience in the face of climate change?

**Basic Latin Dance Steps and Climate Change Themes**

Lead students through a series of basic Latin dance steps, connecting each movement to Global Goal 13.

Emphasize clear instructions, repetition, and a supportive learning environment.

Encourage students to focus on the feeling and intention behind the movement, not just the technical execution.

Examples of dance steps and climate change connections:

- *Basic salsa step (Target 13.1 - Resilience and Adaptation) [*VIDEO REFERENCE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV8cDpJa2f4)*
  - It’s a three-step weight change: step forward, step in place, step back. This represents our ability to adapt and move forward even when faced with challenges. Imagine the rhythm as the steady heartbeat of the Earth, and our steps as our collective response to climate change. We step forward with hope, step in place to assess the situation, and step back to learn from the past.
- *Merengue March (Target 13.2 - Integrating Climate Measures) [*VIDEO REFERENCE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBNP9Z0Dp24)*
  - It’s a marching step with a hip movement. This represents the steady progress we need to make in implementing climate policies. Each step is a policy, each hip movement is the energy and commitment we bring to the process. We move together, in unison, symbolizing the need for coordinated global action.
- *Cumbia Side-to-Side (Target 13.3 - Education and Awareness) [*VIDEO REFERENCE*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNwlRUSEwCs)*
  - It’s a simple step to the side, then a step together. This symbolizes the sharing of information and raising awareness about climate change. We move side to side, reaching out to others, sharing our knowledge and inspiring them to join the movement. The rhythmic flow represents the continuous spread of education.
- *Salsa Turn (Target 13.a - Mobilizing Finance) [*VIDEO REFERENCE*](https://www.google.com/search?q=salsa+turn+simple+how+to+video&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1124US1124&oq=salsa+turn+simple+how+to+video&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRifBdIBCDUwNDJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:461ff784,vid:1YErvRhQEEE,st:12)*
  - It’s a circular movement, representing the flow of financial resources. Imagine this as the money flowing from developed countries to support climate action in developing countries. It’s a continuous, dynamic movement, symbolizing the ongoing need for funding and collaboration.
- *Cumbia Circle (Target 13.b - Capacity Building)*
  - Building on the Cumbia side-to-side step, we will utilize this step and add a group movement, symbolizing communities coming together to build capacity and resilience. We move in a circle, supporting each other, sharing our strengths, and working towards a common goal. This represents the power of collective action, especially for those most vulnerable to climate change.

Throughout the dance sequences, provide:

- Clear and concise instructions.
- Demonstrations of each step.
- Encouragement and positive reinforcement.
- Connections between the movements and climate change themes.

**Creative Expression and Improvisation**

After learning the basic steps, encourage students to explore their own creative expression.

Play the chosen Latin music and invite students to:

- Improvise using the steps they’ve learned.
- Express their feelings about climate change through movement.
- Connect with the energy and rhythm of the music.
- Move in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to them.

Provide prompts or suggestions if needed:

- How would you move to represent the power of nature?
- Can you show the urgency of the climate crisis through your movement?
- How can you express hope and resilience through dance?

Lead a gentle cool-down to bring the energy back down and prepare for reflection. 

Include stretching, deep breathing, and calming movements.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What was your experience with the Latin dance and climate change exploration?
- Which dance steps or movements resonated most with you?
- How did the music and rhythm influence your understanding of the issues?
- What did you learn about your own capacity for expression and action?
- How can dance be a tool for communication and social change?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through writing or discussion.

Ask guiding questions like:

- Did the activity make you think differently about the interconnectedness of different aspects of climate action, from policy to community building?
- How does the sense of community and collective effort in line dancing relate to the global collaboration needed to address climate change?
- Did any particular dance step of musical rhythm resonate with your personal feelings about climate change or inspire you to take action?
- What emotions did you connect with during this dance activity, and how might those emotions motivate you to contribute to climate solutions?

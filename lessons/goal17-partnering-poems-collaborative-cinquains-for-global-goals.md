## Partnering Poems: Collaborative Cinquains for Global Goals

**(30-60 MINUTES)** 

**Materials:**

Paper or notebooks

Pens/pencils

Whiteboard or large chart paper

Markers


**Introduction**

Begin by introducing cinquain poetry.

A cinquain is a short, five-line poem with a specific structure, often focusing on a single idea or image. There are different ways to write a cinquain, but we’ll use a simple pattern today based on the number of words per line.

Explain the basic structure:

- *Line 1:* One word (the topic).
- *Line 2:* Two words (describing the topic).
- *Line 3:* Three words (an action related to the topic).
- *Line 4:* Four words (expressing a feeling or further describing the action).
- *Line 5:* One word (a conclusion or another word for the topic).

Share examples of cinquain poetry:

- Ocean

`	`Vast, blue

`	`Swiring, crashing, deep

`	`Home to creatures big and small

`	`Water

- Partnership

  Strong, vital

  Sharing, building, growing

  Working together for the future

  Unity

Emphasize the concise and impactful nature of cinquain and how it can capture a core idea quickly.

Introduce or reintroduce UN Global Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Emphasize that tis goal is about how countries, organizations, and people around the world need to work together to achieve all the other Global Goals for Sustainable Development.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 17: strengthening domestic resources, official development assistance, mobilizing financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, trade, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Connect Global Goal 17 and Cinquain Poetry.

- How can the short, focused structure of a cinquain help us capture the essence of global partnerships?
- Can we use single words and short phrases to represent complex ideas like collaboration or shared resources?
- How can we work together to build surprising and meaningful poems about achieving the Global Goals for Sustainable Development through partnerships?

**Collaborative Cinquain Creation: Partnering in Verse**

Lead a whole-class brainstorming session, focusing on keywords and concepts related to Global Goal 17 and its various targets. Write these words on the whiteboard.

Examples:

- *Finance:* Support, funding, sharing, resources.
- *Technology:* Innovation, transfer, access, knowledge.
- *Cooperation:* Together, global, united, regional.
- *Trade:* Exchange, markets, fair, growth.
- *Capacity Building:* Learning, training, empowering, strengthening.
- *Partnership:* Alliance, network, collaboration, joining.
- *Development:* Progress, growth, future, sustainable.

Guide the class to work together in creating several cinquain poems, line by line, ensuring everyone contributes and the poems take surprising and engaging turns.

Examples of writing process:

- *Focus on General Partnership*
  - Let’s start a cinquain about partnership. What’s a strong single word to begin?
  - Now, two words that describe partnership?
  - Three words showing action related to partnership?
  - Four words expressing a feeling or further describing the action of partnership?
  - Finally, one word that concludes or is another word for partnership?

Actively call on different students for each line and/or word, encouraging diverse word choices and unexpected combinations. Students can also write down their words/lines and hand them in to share anonymously, having the class choose.

**Small Group Sharing and Interpretation**

Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).

Each group discusses the collaboratively written cinquain poems. Ask guiding questions like:

- What are the key ideas or images that emerged in our poems?
- How do the different lines connect to the concept of global partnerships and the targets of Global Goal 17?
- Were there any surprising or unexpected word choices that created interesting meanings?
- What overall message about working together for sustainable development do our poems convey?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the structured yet collaborative nature of the cinquain help us to explore the complexities of global partnerships in a concise way?
- What did you learn about the power of single words and short phrases to convey big ideas related to collaboration, resources, or technology transfer?
- Did the process of building a poem line by line, with each student contributing without knowing the full outcome, surprise you? How does this reflect real-world partnerships?
- How did working together tgo create these poems enhance your understanding of the importance of listening and building upon others’ ideas?
- What did you discover about your own creative contributions when working within a very specific poetic framework?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 17 and the critical importance of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development through this activity?
- How did the words and themes that emerged in our cinquains highlight different facets or challenges related to Global Goal 17 (e.g., financial aid, technology sharing, capacity building, trade)?
- Did the activity make you think differently about who needs to partner to solve global problems and why their diverse contributions are essential?
- What common themes or powerful messages about unity, cooperation, or the future emerged across the different cinquains we created?
- How can ev en a short, collaboratively written poem help to advocate for the goals of international cooperation?

## **The Ocean’s Palette: Watercolor for Life Below Water**

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials**

Watercolor paper (one sheet per student)

Watercolor paints

Watercolor brushes

Containers for water

Paper towels or sponges

Palette or mixing surface (can be as simple as plastic plates or lids)

Images or videos of: diverse marine life, ocean pollution, the beauty and fragility of marine ecosystems, sustainable practices.

**Introduction**

Begin with an engaging introduction to UN Global Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Emphasize the importance of the oceans for life on Earth, their biodiversity, and the threats they face. If wanted, review any key targets and indicators.

Facilitate a class discussion:

- What are some of your favorite things about the ocean?
- What are some of the biggest threats to marine life?
- How can art help us express our connection to the ocean and inspire action?

Explain that watercolor is a versatile medium that uses pigments suspended in water.

Demonstrate basic techniques (if needed):

- *Wet-on-wet:* Applying wet paint to wet paper for soft, blended effects.
- *Wet-on-dry:* Applying wet paint to dry paper for sharper edges.
- *Graded washes:* Creating smooth transitions from dark to light.
- *Lifting:* Removing paint with a brush or sponge to create highlights.
- *Layering:* Applying multiple washes of color to build depth.

Encourage students to experiment with these techniques on scrap paper.

Emphasize that watercolor is forgiving and encourages spontaneity.

**Watercolor Exploration and Concept Development**

Guide the students in a watercolor exploration connected to Global Goal 14.

Use guided imagery and sketching. Lead a short guided imagery exercise. Example:

- Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Imagine yourself floating in the ocean. What do you see? What do you feel? What sounds do you hear? Picture a vibrant coral reef filled with life. Now, imagine that reef becoming bleached and lifeless. How does that make you feel? Imagine a school of fish swimming freely. Now, imagine them caught in a net. What emotions arise?

After the guided imagery, students spend a few minutes sketching their initial ideas on paper.

Facilitate a class brainstorming session to generate ideas for watercolor paintings inspired by Global Goal 14.

Provide examples and prompts:

- **Global Goal 14** *(Overall)*
  - Watercolor of the ocean’s surface, showing both its calm beauty and underlying power.
  - Abstract painting using flowing colors to represent the interconnectedness of ocean currents and ecosystems.
  - Watercolor depicting the diversity of marine life, from microscopic plankton to giant whales.
  - Painting that contrasts a healthy, vibrant marine environment with a polluted or damaged one.
  - Watercolor of a human figure interacting with the ocean in a sustainable and respectful way.
  - Abstract representation of the ocean’s fragility and the need for protection.
  - Watercolor of a wave, symbolizing both the ocean’s power and the urgency of the climate crisis.
  - Painting that uses light and shadow to convey the mystery and depth of the ocean’s unexplored regions.
- **Target 14.1** *(Marine Pollution)*
  - Watercolor of plastic debris swirling in the ocean.
  - Abstract representation of chemical pollution with flowing colors.

  - Painting with a focus on the connection between people and the ocean.
- **Target 14.a** *(Marine Technology)*
  - Artistic representation of underwater exploration or research vessels.
  - Watercolor that uses light and shadow to convey the depth and mystery of marine technology.
- **Target 14.b** (Access for Small-Scale Artisanal Fishers)
  - *Watercolor of traditional fishing boats and practices.*
  - *Painting highlighting the cultural heritage of fishing.*
- ***Target 14.c** (Implementation of International Law)*
  - Abstract depiction of global cooperation and interconnectedness.
  - Abstract painting with flowing lines and movement to symbolize the ocean’s vastness and groups working together.

Encourage students to:

- Choose a target or aspect of Global Goal 14 (or the goal as a whole) that resonates with them.
- Consider the emotions they want to evoke in the viewer.
- Experiment with different watercolor techniques.

**Watercolor Painting**

Students create their watercolor paintings based on their chosen concept.

Provide guidance and support:

- Offer tips on watercolor techniques.
- Encourage experimentation and creativity.
- Help students refine their compositions when needed.

Emphasize that the focus is on expressing ideas and emotions, not achieving perfect realism.

**Presentation and Discussion**

If time allows, students can present their completed artworks to the class.

Facilitate a discussion after each presentation, or after all presentations are finished. Ask questions like:

- What is the main message of the painting(s)?
- How did the artist(s) use watercolor techniques to convey their message(s)?
- How does the artwork(s) relate to Goal 14 and its targets?
- What impact do you think the artwork(s) could have on viewers?
- What did you learn about the ocean and its challenges through creating this art?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using watercolors, with their fluidity, transparency, and blending qualities, help you express your ideas and emotions about the ocean and its challenges?
- What did you lean about the power of color and composition to convey messages about marine pollution, biodiversity, or conservation?
- Did creating a watercolor piece about the ocean deepen your personal connection to marine life or the need for its protection?
- What did you discover about your own creative voice when translating your understanding of Global Goal 14 into a visual form?
- How can art, specifically painting, help to make abstract concepts about ocean health more tangible and emotionally resonant?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 14 and the importance of conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine resources through this artistic exploration?
- How did your artwork, and those created by your classmates, highlight the diverse issues facing life below water (e.g., pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, acidification)?
- What common themes of powerful messages about the ocean’s beauty, fragility, or resilience emerged across the different artworks you saw?
- How does visual art help to advocate for the ocean and inspire people to care about its future?
- Did creating your watercolor artwork spark any personal connections or reflections on your own experiences with the ocean or its wellbeing?

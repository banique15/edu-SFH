**Introduction**

`	`Welcome students to an engaging dance and movement class. Explain that they will use their bodies and imaginations to explore a really important idea: Global Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.

`	`Clarify that Global Goal 12 is like a huge promise the world has made; a promise to be smarter about the things we use and make. Emphasize that this means:

- *Being mindful:* Thinking about what we buy and if we really need it.
- *Reducing waste:* Using less, and throwing away less.
- *Reusing and recycling:* Finding new lives for old things.

`	`It’s about making things in a way that’s good for the planet and making sure we don’t use up all our planet’s resources, so there’s enough for a long time.

`	`Introduce the concept of Guided Imagery. Explain that guided imagery is a technique where you use descriptive language to guide students to visualize and imagine a specific scenario or story. Clarify that the goal today is for students to tap into their imagination and explore these visualizations through movement, connecting their mind and body.

`	`Emphasize that there or no right or wrong ways to move, and the students will be encouraged to interpret the imagery in their own way.

`	`Lead a brief, simple guided imagery exercise to introduce the concept.

- Instruct students to close their eyes gently or soften their gaze. Guide them through the exercise, slowly and with intention (no movement is necessary from students during this guided introduction):
  - Imagine you are a tiny seed in the ground. Feel how small and still you are. Now, imagine a gentle rain starts to fall. Slowly, your roots begin to grow down, and your stem pushes up towards the sun. Feel yourself stretching and growing. Now, you are a tall, strong plant, swaying gently in the breeze. Your branches reach up towards the sky, and you feel a sense of strength and life.

`	`Facilitate a short discussion after this introduction, asking guiding questions like:

- What images came to mind during that exercise?
- How did the imagery of the seed and the rain make your body want to move?
- How can we use our imagination and movement to explore other ideas?

**Object Transformation Stretch**

`	`*The First Object*

- Have students imagine that they are an everyday object that is old and used, like an empty bottle or a pair of shoes that have been thrown away. 
- Ask guiding questions to help students imagine the movements that might connect to these objects:
  - What kind of shape does your body make?
  - Is it hard, stiff, and empty?
  - How does your body feel when it’s still and discarded?
  - What does it feel like to be a flat piece of cardboard, or a crumpled up can?
  - If you had a voice, what sound would you make as an old, tired object? Can you translate that into a movement?
  - Where does your body feel heavy or useless?
- Guide students to make simple shapes with their bodies.

`	`*The Transformation*

- Now, have students imagine a wave a creative energy washing over them, and slowly, the old shape of the object (and themselves) begins to transform into something new and useful.
- Ask guiding questions to help students imagine the movements that might connect to this transformation:
  - What does your body become now?
  - How does your body feel as it slowly changes and stretches into something new?
  - What movement shows the new object’s purpose?
  - If your new shape had a feeling, what would it be? Can you translate that feeling into movement?
  - Where in your body do you feel this new, creative energy the most?
  - How does your body show that it’s no longer just a used object, but a useful and vibrant part of the world?

`	`*The Second Object*

- Now, ask students to imagine a different object, also old and used, and have them make the shape inspired by this object.

`	`*The Second Transformation*

- Students again transform into a new, useful object, showing this tranformation with their bodies and movement.

`	`Conclude warm up by affirming the ability to connect movement and imagination to the idea of repurposing and reuse.

**Consumption Lifecycle Map**

`	`Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Provide each group with a large piece of paper and markers.

`	`Instruct each group to draw a simple flow chart or comic strip type drawing with three or four panels. The drawing should include:

- *(Panel 1) Creation/Use:* An object being made or used for the first time.
- *(Panel 2) Waste:* The object is thrown away.
- *(panel 3) Solution/Reuse:* The object is repurposed or recycled.

`	`For each panel/section, instruct groups to brainstorm:

- *Feelings:* what emotion or feeling goes with this part of the object’s journey? (e.g., happy, busy, sad, wasteful, smart, proud).
- *Key Movements:* What specific movements or body shapes would show this part of the story? (e.g., strong repetitive movements, slow heavy movements, light bouncy movements).

`	`Circulate, offering guidance and asking guiding questions like:

- How can you show the sad feeling of trash with a body shape?
- What kind of movement shows recycling as an active and happy thing?

**Guided Imagery and Movement Exploration**

`	`Explain that the class will now go on a guided movement journey based on the brainstormed ideas.

`	`Lead the class through a series of imagery sequences, with students following along with their own organic movements.

`	`Play a mix of music, choosing what is appropriate for your students and classroom.

`	`Examples:

- [“Merry-Go-Round of Life”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7SS57LFPco), Joe Hisaishi (from Howl’s Moving Castle)
- [“The Scientist”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMHH9bOPa28) (Instrumental), Coldplay

`	`Guided Imagery Prompts

`	`*(Phase 1) The Problem:*

- Imagine you are an object being made in a large factory. You move with a fast, repetitive rhythm.
  - Guide students to move quickly and robotically.
- Now, you are used up and thrown away. Feel your body become heavy, slow, and discarded, like trash. Feel how wasteful that is.
  - Guide students into slow, heavy, slumped movements.

`	`*(Phase 2) The Solution, Transformation and Reuse*

- Now, imagine a wave of creativity and change washes over you. You feel a new, smart idea! Slowly, your body begins to transform and stretch, becoming a new, useful, and beautiful thing.
  - Guide students through a slow, expansive, and creative transformation.
- You are now part of a community that reuses, reduces, and recycles. Your movement is light, bouncy, and joyful, showing that you are part of a sustainable world!
  - Guide students in light, free, and happy movements.

`	`*(Phase 3) Hope for the Future*

- Now, imagine a world where every object has a second life, where there is no waste. How do you move in that world? Is your movement calm and flowing? Is it strong and connected?
  - Guide students through a peaceful, unified, and strong collective movement.

`	`Encourage students throughout to listen to their bodies, connect with the emotions of the imagery, and explore different ways of interpreting the visualizations through movement.

**Creative Movement Exploration**

`	`Explain that there will now be a short period of free movement exploration. Instruct students to reflect on the internal images and emotions they experiences during the guided imagery.

`	`Invite students to explore their own movement responses to the themes of consumption, waste, and sustainability. 

Provide prompts or suggestions to guide the exploration, if helpful. Examples:

- How would you move to represent the idea of excessive consumption?
- Can you show through movement the concept of reducing waste?
- How can you express your hope for a sustainable future through your body?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the guided imagery and movement exploration help you connect with the concepts of responsible consumption and production on a deeper, more embodied level?
- What sensations or emotional shifts did you experience in your body as you moved through the different visualizations related to Global Goal 12?
- Did physically embodying concepts like waste transformation or sustainable practices offer you new insights that words alone might not have?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 12 and the importance of sustainable consumption and production patterns through this movement activity?
- What is one key takeaway about responsible consumption and the power of creative expression that you will remember from this lesson?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the warm up, initial guided imagery exercise, brainstorm, creative movement explorations, and discussions.
- Understanding of the core concept of responsible consumption and production (reducing waste, reusing, recycling), as demonstrated through the intentions and interpretations conveyed in the movements and verbal contributions during discussions.
- Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract or descriptive imagery into physical movement. Look for clear effort in expressing the feeling and concept.
- Ability to work effectively within the small groups during the brainstorm and creative movement, respecting the diverse interpretations and contributing cohesively.
- Ability to articulate learning and personal connections during the reflection and summary discussions.

## Finding Our Balance: A Global Goal 16 Movement & Dance Exploration

**(30-60 MINUTES)**

**Materials:**

Audio 

Open space suitable for movement

Whiteboard or large chart paper 

Markers

Paper 

Pens/pencils 


**Introduction**

Begin by introducing dance as a way to tell a story or express a feeling without words. Explain to students that we will use our bodies to understand a very important goal about building a peaceful and fair world.

Introduce a few simple building blocks of movement that anyone can use:

- *Flow:* Show the difference between smooth, flowing movements (like a peaceful river) and sharp, jerky movements (like a sudden conflict).
- *Force:* Demonstrate a strong, powerful movement (like a fist coming down to represent justice) and a light, gentle movement (like a butterfly fluttering).
- *Shape:* Show how to make a body shape that is open and welcoming (like arms wide open) and a shape that is closed and guarded (like arms crossed over the chest).
- *Level:* Explain the difference between moving on a high level (standing tall), a medium level (crouching), and a low level (crawling on the floor).

Explain to students that these simple movements will be the language we use to tell our story.

**A Movement for Justice: Guided Exploration**

Lead the class through a series of movement explorations, connecting each one to a theme from Global Goal 16. Play music that matches the mood of each section.

Examples of Movement Explorations Connected to Global Goal 16:

- *Peace and Harmony (Target 16.1):*
  - Ask students to find their own space and move with a slow, flowing quality. Let their arms and bodies create gentle curves, like a peaceful garden or a calm breeze. Prompt students to embody a feeling of calm and non-violence through these movements.
- *Justice and Fairness (Target 16.3):*
  - Ask students to find a strong, balanced stance. Move with deliberate, grounded steps. Ask them to show a movement that represents balance and equality, perhaps by holding their arms out like a scale. Prompt students to physically feel the idea of fairness and justice through their dancing.
- *Building Strong Institutions (Target 16.6):*
  - Ask students to move together as a group. Move with a sense of connection, perhaps by rising and falling together, or moving in unison to a beat. Prompt students to embody how a strong community is built when people work together.
- *Addressing Conflict (Target 16.1):*
  - Use sharp, angular movements to show conflict. Ask students to slowly soften their movements and find a way to connect with another student they are moving away from. Challenge students to show both the feeling of a disagreement and the process of finding a solution.
- *Inclusivity and Transparency (Targets 16.7 and 16.10):*
  - Ask students to use open, expansive gestures, reaching outwards as if inviting others to join or sharing something important. Have students move around the space, making eye contact with others and welcoming all into their space. Prompt students to embody the ideas of welcoming everyone and being honest.

Throughout these explorations, encourage students to find their own way to express these feelings and ideas with dance and movement. Remind them there there is no right or wrong way to move.

**Creative Movement Exploration**

After the guided exploration, play a mix of music that could be connected to the ideas and themes of Global Goal 16. Let the class know that this is a chance to use everything they’ve learned to create their own movements.

Ask students to choose an idea they’ve learned about Global Goal 16 that they feel strongly about. Ask guiding questions to help bring up embodied feelings, like:

- How would you show this idea with your movement through dance?
- Would you show the feeling of being heard, or the feeling of being ignored?
- Would you show a group of people building something together, or a single person standing up for what is right?

Give students a few minutes to explore their own movements. Circulate and provide encouraging words or ideas to students if needed.

**Cool Down and Discussion**

Lead a gentle cool down, having students stretch and breathe slowly to prepare to discuss.

Facilitate a class discussion, asking guiding questions like:

- What was your experience with the movement exploration?
- What did you like or dislike?
- Which movement or theme was the most powerful for you? Why?
- What did you learn about your own ability to express ideas with movement and dance?
- How can dance and movement be a tool for communication and for helping others understand big ideas and problems, or solutions?

**Reflection & Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did using your body to move help you understand big ideas like peace and justice in a new way? Did it feel different from just reading about it or watching a video?
- The movements and dances we made today shows problems and solutions. What is one small thing you can do to help make your school or community a more fair and peaceful place?
- What did you learn about the importance of using art to tell stories that can help people understand a big problem and inspire them to help find and work towards a solution?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and enthusiastic involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the guided movement explorations, creative exploration, and class discussion.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 16 themes (e.g., reducing violence, access to justice, strong institutions) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in movement and verbal explanations during discussions.
- Originality and effectiveness in translating abstract concepts into physical movement. This can be seen in the unique ways movement elements (flow, force, shape, level) were used to tell the story.
- How clearly and powerfully the movements communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 16. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion related to the goal?
- Ability to work effectively as a class, demonstrating active listening, responsive movement, and a cohesive group dynamic during shared explorations.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of documentary theater in advocating for social justice and the complexities of achieving peace and fairness.

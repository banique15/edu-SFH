**Introduction**

Begin with an introduction to guided group meditation in movement.

- Guided group meditation in movement is a way to explore inner states and connect with others through shared, gentle movement and focused attention. Unlike structured dance, it emphasizes internal awareness and collective presence rather than specific steps or performance.
- We’ll use guided imagery and simple movements to explore the themes of Global Goal 17, focusing on how inner awareness and a sense of collective presence can mirror and support global partnerships.

Explain that the focus will be on:

- Gentle, mindful movement.
- Internal focus and body awareness.
- A sense of shared space and collective energy.
- Responding to guidance and their own inner experience.

Introduce or reintroduce Global Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. Emphasize that achieving this goal requires collaboration and interconnectedness on a global scale.

Briefly review the key themes of Global Goal 17: strengthening domestic resources, official development assistance, mobilizing financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building, trade, and multi-stakeholder partnerships.

Connect Global Goal 17 and guided group meditation by asking guiding questions. Examples:

- How can our inner awareness and sense of connection to each other in this space reflect the interconnectedness needed for global partnerships?
- Can the focus and intention we cultivate individually contribute to a stronger collective energy, mirroring the unified effort required to achieve the Global Goals for Sustainable Development?
- How can the gentle give-and-take of guided movement symbolize the flow of resources, knowledge, and support in global collaborations?

**Guided Group Movement Meditation**

Guide the class through a series of gentle movements and visualizations, each connected to a theme within Global Goal 17. Students are encouraged to move at their own pace and in ways that feel comfortable while maintaining a sense of shared presence in the space. Play gentle instrumental music to set the tone if desired.

**Self Observation**

Bring the meditation to a close, and end with guiding questions that students will answer to themselves.
Examples of guiding questions for self observation:

- How did the feeling of shared presence in the movement meditation relate to the idea of a global partnership?
- Which of the guided images or movements resonated most with you in relation to the specific targets of Global Goal 17?
- How can cultivating inner awareness and a sense of collective intention support real-world collaboration?
- What did you notice about the power of gentle, unified action?
- How can this experience inform your understanding of the interconnectedness required to achieve the Global Goals for Sustainable Development?


**Reflection and Summary**

Have students reflect on their learning experience through discussion or writing.

Ask guiding questions like:

- How did the gentle, shared movements in our meditation help you feel a sense of connection and interconnectedness with your classmates, and by extension, with the global community?
- What sensations or feelings did you experience in your body as you explored concepts like “giving and receiving resources” or “building capacity” through movement?
- Did the act of focusing on your inner awareness while moving with the group deepen your understanding of how individual actions contribute to collective outcomes?
- How can cultivating mindful movement and shared presence, as we did today, parallel the kind of intentional collaboration needed for effective global partnerships?
- What did you learn about the power of non-verbal communication and subtle responsiveness in building a sense of unity?
- What new insights did you gain about Global Goal 17 and the critical importance of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development through this embodied exploration?
- How did the various guided images and movements (e.g., “shared breath,” “flow of resources,” “interconnected web”) illuminate different facets or challenges related to Global Goal 17?
- Did the activity make you think differently about who needs to be involved in global partnerships and why their contributions are essential?
- What common themes or powerful messages about unity, cooperation, or shared responsibility emerged from our collective movement meditation?
- How does an embodied experience like this help to make the abstract concepts of global collaboration more tangible and meaningful?
- Did any particular movement or visualization resonate with you on a personal level, sparking a new perspective on teamwork, giving, or receiving?
- What emotions or motivations did you experience during this lesson, and how might those inspire you to take action related to Global Goal 17?
- What is one key takeaway about global partnerships and the power of collective presence that you will remember from this lesson?
- How has this lesson influenced your thinking about your own role in fostering cooperation in your daily life or community?

**Assessment**

- Consistent and mindful involvement in all phases of the lesson, including the initial guided imagery exercise, subsequent movement explorations, and participation in class discussions.
- Comprehension of Global Goal 17 themes (e.g., financial assistance, technology transfer, capacity building, multi-stakeholder partnerships) as demonstrated through the interpretations conveyed in movement and the verbal explanations during discussion.
- Originality and expressiveness in translating abstract concepts or guided imagery (eg., “shared breath,” “giving and receiving,” “interconnected web”) into physical movement.
- How clearly and powerfully the movements communicated the understanding of specific aspects of Global Goal 17. Did the physical expression successfully evoke thought or emotion related to global partnership?
- Willingness to experiment with and apply different movement qualities (e.g., flowing, expanding, connecting, grounding) to enhance the meaning of the interpretations.
- Ability to connect with and respond to the movements and energy of the collective group, demonstrating a sense of shared presence and subtle collaboration during the meditation.
- Nuance and depth of understanding demonstrated in reflections, particularly concerning the role of embodied learning in understanding global challenges and the complexities of building effective partnerships.
